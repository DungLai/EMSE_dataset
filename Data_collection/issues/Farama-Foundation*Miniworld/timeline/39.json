The `cam_dir` is a direction vector that is computer from `self.agent.dir`, which is the direction angle the camera will be pointed at. If you change this angle, you can change the direction the agent is looking to achieve what you want.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/comments/780271859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4339275596,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQzMzkyNzU1OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/events/4339275596","actor":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-17T03:28:13Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/comments/780798664","html_url":"https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/39#issuecomment-780798664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/39","id":780798664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MDc5ODY2NA==","user":{"login":"cgxuvector","id":44514998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE0OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44514998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector","html_url":"https://github.com/cgxuvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-17T19:32:58Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T19:32:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
