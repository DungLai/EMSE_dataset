It avoids the awkward problem of non-zero value of final state when health=0. \r\n3. It would also boost compatibility with external libraries that avoid updating values based on state transitions that are across two different episodes. This could also throw off some model based methods due to the agent 'jumping' across the map in a single transition. \r\n4. Most external libraries also use done=True signal to properly display learning progress across episodes.\r\n\r\nSome of the above are only problems if health is part of the state.\r\nThe overhead of regenerating the world every time is annoying.
