@maximecb , \r\nThank you again for your kind reply! I finally found that you have a beautiful function \"enjoy.py\" which produces examples of the policy being played, thank you for writing this!\r\n\r\n\r\nA separate question, if I may...  Regarding visualize.py, it seems in line 56 of visualize.py, one must have stored data into csv files to begin with, in order to load this data into visualize.py. Therefore, I want to confirm that we are meant to modify the code to collect the data they want to visualize (like saving episode_rewards into a csv) in order to then use visualize.py, correct?Â In other words, this is not data that can be inherently retrieved from the \".pt\" files to load into visualize, is it?\r\n\r\nThank you again for everything!
