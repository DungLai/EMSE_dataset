`env.get_visible_ents()` which returns a Python set of visible objects. It draws a small bounding box for each object and uses that for the visibility check. In my simple environments this seems to work pretty well. The one issue that I can see is that if you had multiple objects occluding each other, this small bounding box trick would not work as well, because the bounding boxes would not occlude each other. It still seems like an OK visibility approximation to me, but maybe you can try it and let me know.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is this is currently not optimized for performance. Maybe you can try it when you get a chance or when you get back, and if it works well enough for your needs, I will optimize it. I think I can make it run at least 10x faster using display
