I wonder that we are ignoring the directionality of relations?\r\nThank you for your consideration!","closed_by":{"login":"angelotran05","id":5416901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTY5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5416901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05","html_url":"https://github.com/angelotran05","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angelotran05/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
