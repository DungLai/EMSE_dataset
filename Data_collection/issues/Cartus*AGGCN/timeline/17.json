It might be \"under-fitting\" the training set to some extent. However, what we really want to do is to achieve a better result on the test set. Probably you can tune the hyper-parameters to make the model fits the training set better (increase hidden sizes and layers, decrease dropout, etc,.), but I am not sure if you will get a better results on the test set. It is a trade-off.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/comments/553097993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cartus","id":8509368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDkzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8509368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/comments/553216961","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/17#issuecomment-553216961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/17","id":553216961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzIxNjk2MQ==","user":{"login":"troublemeeter","id":32586628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTg2NjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32586628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter","html_url":"https://github.com/troublemeeter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troublemeeter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T03:03:47Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T03:03:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
