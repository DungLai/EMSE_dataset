The attention guided layer is included starting from the second block.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the codes, I created two types of graph convolutional layers from line 126\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# gcn layer\r\nfor i in range(self.num_layers):\r\n    if i == 0:\r\n        self.layers.append(GraphConvLayer(opt, self.mem_dim, self.sublayer_first))\r\n        self.layers.append(GraphConvLayer(opt, self.mem_dim, self.sublayer_second))\r\n    else:\r\n        self.layers.append(MultiGraphConvLayer(opt, self.mem_dim, self.sublayer_first, self.heads))\r\n        self.layers.append(MultiGraphConvLayer(opt, self.mem_dim, self.sublayer_second, self.heads))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the first block, we use the original adjacency matrix from the dependency tree. For the second block, we use the calculated adjacency matrix based on the representations (we assume they have already captured the dependency relations since they are obtained from the first block). You can refer to the code from line 170:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor i in range(len(self.layers)):\r\n    if i < 2:\r\n        outputs = self.layers[i](adj, outputs)\r\n        layer_list.append(outputs)\r\n    else:\r\n        attn_tensor = self.attn(outputs, outputs, src_mask)\r\n        attn_adj_list = [attn_adj.squeeze(1) for attn_adj in torch.split(attn_tensor, 1, dim=1)]\r\n        outputs = self.layers[i](attn_adj_list, outputs)\r\n        layer_list.append(outputs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen i < 2, the adj represents the original dependency tree.\r\n\r\nIn Equation (2), that is a typo. Thank you so much for pointing it out! We do not need value here since we only use the query and key to calculate the correlation scores.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/comments/503508169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cartus","id":8509368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDkzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8509368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/comments/504249496","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/2#issuecomment-504249496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartus/AGGCN/issues/2","id":504249496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDI0OTQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"Cartus","id":8509368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDkzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8509368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T00:55:00Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T00:55:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I

the sum of sublayer_first and sublayer_second?\r\n- As I understand, M is the number of AGGCN blocks, and should be identical to the argument  --num_layers in train.py.
