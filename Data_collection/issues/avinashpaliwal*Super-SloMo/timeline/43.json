Therefore, I always ask myself a question about which loss will be useful (improve PSNR) for my final output, and how much the loss is enough? I might have to tune the weights too many times to figure out. Why don't you train the model and see what will happen :))\r\n\r\nFor example, empirically, in training, I observed that loss_smooth is easier to be converged, more than other losses, we set its weight of 1 might be okay. Meanwhile, prcpLoss is high. If we set the weight of that loss is too high, it would cause worse on final output because your network only concentrates on updating the network's params based on that loss. But if we set it as 0.005, it will improve the quality as well as the perceptual aspect.\r\n\r\nIt is too confused; therefore, they used the term \"empirically\" in the paper. \r\nI usually balance the trade-off between losses (all values are approximate), which also makes a balance in backpropagating error as well as updating weights for your target.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/comments/558938918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"minhmanho","id":24385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzg1NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho","html_url":"https://github.com/minhmanho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minhmanho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/comments/558956338","html_url":"https://github.com/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/43#issuecomment-558956338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/43","id":558956338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODk1NjMzOA==","user":{"login":"ytongW","id":32953021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTUzMDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32953021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW","html_url":"https://github.com/ytongW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytongW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T06:53:36Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T06:53:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your kindly reply!
