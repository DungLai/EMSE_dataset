If you have used the [create_dataset.py](https://github.com/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/blob/master/data/create_dataset.py) as is, then it converts your video to 360p images by default (Unless you pass command-line arguments to change that). So regardless of the original video resolution, your training dataset will be 360p.\r\n2. As part of the pre-processing in the dataloader, the images are by default cropped to dimensions (352, 352). So even if you have a custom dataset, the input by default will be a (352, 352) patch.\r\n\r\nBy default the training and validation batch size is set to 6 and 10. This works for 1080 Ti, but you should try reducing this parameter for the memory issue. You can do that by using `--train_batch_size` and `--validation_batch_size` command-line arguments for
