PIL however doesn't care and while it loads that metadata, it doesn't resave it. Which causes those images opened and resaved to be slightly different due to lack of gamma, despite the RGB values being the exact same for each image. I initially noticed this myself making something similar as superslomo, where instead of loading reference images, i just copied them to the output folder with the correct name/index. Opening  the images in a image viewer and stepping through the folder the change between interpolated images and original ones really shows. \r\n\r\nI do however note, ffmpeg doesn't care about it when creating an output video, so no flickering happens, it either keep or just strips the gamma values from the images, so it's not a big deal in practice, assuming it's the same bug. \r\n\r\nI also think padding images is smarter than cropping, and can be done with PIL quite easily, and added to the Transforms for normalization.
