Without the user telling the program the target framerate, it would have to find that framerate in the original video as well. ffmpeg only extract images and then converts the new images into a video with the user specified framerate. The other case would be to detect framerate with ffprobe for example, putting the burden on the user to supply the path to that as well when running the script. But it's doable to just use original framerate multiplied with the sf factor.
