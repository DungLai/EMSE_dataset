That's a good catch. This was my first deep learning project and I was trying to understand the UNet architecture. I don't remember completely but I think based on the understanding from some sources, I assumed this as the implementation. But maybe the skip connection has to be concatenated to the first conv layer's input. I think I was trying to concatenate e.g. 32 skip channels with 32 channels output of first conv layer instead of 64 channels of upsampled layer. But I don't think this would make a huge difference in the performance of the model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/comments/548917538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"avinashpaliwal","id":43282710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjgyNzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43282710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal","html_url":"https://github.com/avinashpaliwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2777088389,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc3NzA4ODM4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/events/2777088389","actor":{"login":"avinashpaliwal","id":43282710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjgyNzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43282710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal","html_url":"https://github.com/avinashpaliwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-06T22:19:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
