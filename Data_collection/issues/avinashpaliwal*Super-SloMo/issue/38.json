I dont understand, where are the lost pixs?\r\n     Another issue goes like this : my own dataset got the mean[0.696, 0.456, 0.957],and i changed the mean number in train.py  . After  I used the model created by train.py   ,i forgot to changed the mean number in video_to_slomo.py  which default[0.429, 0.431, 0.397],then i get some images in hidden tmpSuperSloMo/output folder . I compare  these images with the result images after i change the mean number in video_to_slomo.py.  They are totally same! !  Why mean parameter in video_to_slomo.py does not working? Did i misunderstand something? Please let me know.
