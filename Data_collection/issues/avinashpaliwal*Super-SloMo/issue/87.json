See issue below. \r\n\r\nBut is it possible to add a local file to the google collab code? \r\n\r\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/github/tugstugi/dl-colab-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/SuperSloMo.ipynb#scrollTo=3KUlO4oiA8CM\r\n\r\nI have no clue how to do this myself though. Never worked with colab before and it would be very nice if I get this to run by sunday for a project. \r\n\r\nI am not pushing to be clear! Just need to know if I have to look further for something else or if this would be possible via your code. \r\n\r\nAnyways very very nice work!!!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/87/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
