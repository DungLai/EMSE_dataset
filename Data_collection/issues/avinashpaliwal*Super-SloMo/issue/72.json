My input video is a 10-second one, however, the output one is still 10 seconds long, it is just playing at 90fps instead of 30. \r\nSo my question would be, are there any flags I should set up in [video_to_slomo.py: 80](https://github.com/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/blob/a3be3dbc363f48f2cdaafc7224597dbd5a0d9370/video_to_slomo.py#L80) to make sure the output video is 3x longer than the input one but both of them playing in 30 fps?","closed_by":{"login":"Microos","id":14972757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTcyNzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14972757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos","html_url":"https://github.com/Microos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Microos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
