In the readme it simply shows a easy example of how you should set these variables but on the surface It seems kinda redundant and adds confusion/user error. If you have a 10 sec 30fps video 300 frames total and you want to multiply  it by 3 then by default you would expect 90fps and 900 frames total. So what benefit/reasons is their for making us provide both the multiplication factor and fps.  It seems like something that would just lead to mistakes like stating 60fps when it was supposed to be 90fps. \r\n\r\nIf their are particular scenarios where someone would purposefully not keep these values lined up then what would they be? wouldn't it just be better to just automatically calculate the correct video fps unless a specific fps was explicitly passed?\r\n\r\nI think adding this info into the readme or as a link someone can follow from within the readme will be helpful.
