The saved reference frames are first resized to 1280,704,  and than later resize back to 1280, 720. This makes the saved reference frames not identical to the original frames anymore. \r\n\r\nAnd this will have artifacts on the interpolated frames.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution, I considered, is to first patch the video width and height to some multiple of 32, to avoid the resize, and cut the patch after interpolation. \r\n\r\n** The reverse normalization does not give the same result.\r\nAnother issue is that, the reverse normalization TP, do not give the same image.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/64/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/64/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
