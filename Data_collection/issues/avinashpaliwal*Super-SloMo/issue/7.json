I'm currently evaluating on a CPU (AMD Threradripper 1920x) as I don't have a CUDA device but I'm having trouble with the output from the video_to_slomo.py script. As a reference, I used ffmpeg to convert your original gif to mp4 and tried to create a video but the output looks a bit off. This is what the converted video looks like: [Link here](https://imgur.com/a/v3L4cSO). Another video I tried also looks like [this](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BtAEpHL62Uy4Xxz4A).
