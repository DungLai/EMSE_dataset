I do not got an available GPU at hand now（shared with someone else ）,so I'm not able to compare the two algs.  Any information about the inference speed of this alg？\r\nOr any Chance that this Super-SloMo could run on a ARM64 Phone\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"avinashpaliwal","id":43282710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjgyNzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43282710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal","html_url":"https://github.com/avinashpaliwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avinashpaliwal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
