For example, using ffmpeg, we can remove alternate frames from a video stream. And then interpolate using Super-SloMo. After that we can calculate the PSNR/SSIM of the interpolated frames with respect to the original ground truth frames. This way, if there are other interpolation methods, the PSNR/SSIM can be compared for different algorithms. \r\n\r\nI saw some PSNR numbers on UCF-101 dataset but am not sure if those numbers mean something similar. \r\n\r\n-Raj","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
