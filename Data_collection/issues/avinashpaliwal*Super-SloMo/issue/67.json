However, I cannot reproduce the performance that you released:   \r\n\r\n> pretrained mine\t29.77\t0.874\t15.58\r\n\r\nWhat I got is  \r\n\r\n>  PSNR: 24.54, SSIM: 0.762, IE: 24.64\r\n\r\nThe result obtained by **get_results_bug_fixed.sh** script.\r\nIt's much worse than yours. And I have no idea what is going wrong.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe complete script can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/chuchienshu/aa7e9a98fb4db54c124f7813a28d7fa5). So it's easily to reproduce this Bug. In fact, I just adapted part of your code to perform single frame interpolation.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS:  Ubuntu\r\n - Device Used: GPU\r\n - Setup Info:  PyTorch 0.4.1, Python 3.5.2\r\n\r\nAny suggestion would be appreciated.
