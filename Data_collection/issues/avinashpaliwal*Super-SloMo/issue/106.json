I love it, and I've been using it successfully since early January. However, in the past week or so, it has stopped working on every colab fork I've tried. Perhaps there has been an incompatible version update in a dependency somewhere?\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nAfter loading the dependencies, I input the file path to the uploaded video I want to interpolate. On execution, I get the attached error, which is a standard error being thrown by the process.communicate() method in <module>().\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nBehavior happens every time. Colab is not running out of memory, as I use CO Pro+ and I have taken the images down to 100x100 pixels and 50 total frames to ensure the file is sufficiently small to rule out running out of RAM as the issue.\r\n1. Visit Colab at:\r\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/github/MSFTserver/AI-Colab-Notebooks/blob/main/Super_SloMo.ipynb#scrollTo=Wz4BaariVdh5\r\n2. Run cells in \"Download Super-Slomo Repo & Model\"\r\n3. Run cells in \"Run this block and Upload Video by clicking the Button that pops up below this codeblock! Wait till it loads the video and once it's done run the next block\"\r\n4. Navigate in dialog box to file and upload file to server.\r\n5. No need to enter file path in this particular notebook as the upload itself conveys the file path.\r\n6. Run the main code.\r\n7. Error/Abnormal behavior\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUp until this week when the error started, the colab output 2 files... the first being the .mkv file that the program encodes natively and then the .mp4 that results from conversion.\r\n\r\n**Interpolated results/error output**\r\n![Super Slow Mo Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100682542/156150735-dc68c7a2-252a-4f73-936e-35553add6606.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10 Pro, MacOS Monterey 12.2.1\r\n - Device Used: Colab Pro+ GPU\r\n - Setup Info: All dependencies needed for this notebook is pulled in Step 1 above, and noted in the attached error report/traceback.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNo additional context other than I have been having the same issue in each notebook that I am aware of which fork off the main repository, not just the one I've linked to here.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help, I really miss this utility!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo/issues/106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
