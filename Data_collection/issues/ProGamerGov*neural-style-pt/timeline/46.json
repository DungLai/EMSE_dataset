I also just started [a new branch](https://github.com/genekogan/neural-style-pt/tree/histogram-loss) which replaces gram loss with @pierre-wilmot's histogram loss as described [here](https://github.com/pierre-wilmot/NeuralTextureSynthesis). I'm getting interesting results with it, but the big gap in the middle remains. I'm pretty stumped. I might start trying more hacky approaches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/comments/561010070/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"genekogan","id":1335251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1335251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan","html_url":"https://github.com/genekogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genekogan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2848623759,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg0ODYyMzc1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/events/2848623759","actor":{"login":"pierre-wilmot","id":44589862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTg5ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44589862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot","html_url":"https://github.com/pierre-wilmot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-03T05:49:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2848623769,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NDg2MjM3Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/events/2848623769","actor":{"login":"pierre-wilmot","id":44589862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTg5ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44589862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot","html_url":"https://github.com/pierre-wilmot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-wilmot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-03T05:49:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/comments/561759968","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/46#issuecomment-561759968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/46","id":561759968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTc1OTk2OA==","user":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":fals
