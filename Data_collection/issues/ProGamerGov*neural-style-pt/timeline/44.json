I understand now except what is the difference between say relu1_1 and relu1_2? Are they both more style based (not content) but trained on different image sets? if so wouldn't using both always be more robust (being able to pick from a larger set of iamges) unless the item you are matching happens to be a specialty of just one or the other?

Models that were created by fine-tuning an existing model (like `VGG16_SOD_finetune`) had their lower layers frozen for the most part, and only the upper most layers were given new information.

(Don't know the author).\r\n\r\n- [Experiments on different loss configurations for style transfer](https://towardsdatascience.com/experiments-on-different-loss-configurations-for-style-transfer-7e3147eda55e)  \r\n\r\n- [Practical techniques for getting style transfer to work](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-techniques-for-getting-style-transfer-to-work-19884a0d69eb)  \r\n\r\nBut in my experience, these relations change between style images. You can use a loop to iterate between some combinations, with few `-num_iterations`, to check best matches, or use techniques like [multires](https://github.com/ProGamerGov/Multiscale-Resolution-Scripts).

multires scripts are great. If I understand this correctly, none of these would allow a larger imagine to be outputted than what gpu memory would normally allow on a single pass/render, correct? However, they obviously allow content or style effects not possible on a single pass/scale. \r\n\r\nThe seg one uses masks and dithers them to the whole. Does the masked region really only use the memory primarily? What I mean is if divided the image into 4 quadrants and made a mask for each, could we render an image roughly 4 times larger by doing a pass (or passes) on each quadrant? Or is it still primarily affected by the total size of the original unmasked image?\r\n\r\nAlso, my GTX 1080 8 GB cannot handle the larger sizes in these multires scripts so I adjusted them to never exceed about an 1100 pixel size which is about where I max out. I may try Google collab next to get more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/comments/549141011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"qwerdbeta","id":36677267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Njc3MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36677267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta","html_url":"https://github.com/qwerdbeta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/comments/549163317","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/44#issuecomment-549163317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/44","id":549163317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTE2MzMxNw==","user":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-03T18:09:54Z","updated_at":"2019-11-03T18:09:54Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@qwerdbeta The trick with multires is to maximize quality in terms of parameters until you run out of memory. Then you adjust your parameters (replace L-BFGS with Adam, switch models, etc...) so that you can keep pushing the image size higher. If you look closely, most multires scripts do this. Most of the major changes occur at the smaller image sizes, so it's not that much of a concern to switch out memory hungry parameters at higher image sizes. You aren't supposed to or even able to take VGG-19 and L-BFGS to the highest possible resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've actually never tested that before, so I have no idea. The only issues I can foresee with that approach, is that you have to find a way to blend the stylizes areas together meaninglessly.

I have been doing many experiments in a row that are somewhat repetitive and the multires is another good example.

Is there a way to do multi-pass style transfer where the model is cumulative and uses the style and content associations from previous runs?
