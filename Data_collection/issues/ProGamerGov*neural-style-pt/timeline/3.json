Any differences to report? \r\n\r\nThe same multiscale resolution technique from Neural-Style, works with Neural-Style-PT as well. I haven't noticed any difference in the effectiveness of the technique with Neural-Style-PT.\r\n\r\n> Any changes in the GPU memory ceilings / resolution limits? Any new scaling scripts to share?\r\n\r\nMy code is already faster and more memory efficient than Justin Johnson's code, so large image sizes are possible. PyTorch is also under active development, and as such its performance is likely to be improved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/comments/422601202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2081753730,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA4MTc1MzczMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/events/2081753730","actor":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T00:41:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/comments/554084645","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/3#issuecomment-554084645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/3","id":554084645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDA4NDY0NQ==","user":{"login":"spot92","id":57643759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjQzNzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57643759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92","html_url":"https://github.com/spot92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spot92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-14T21:19:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T21:19:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I may need to mess with some settings then as I have been unable to do an image size larger than 1440 wide (per the image_size option) on a 1080 ti.
