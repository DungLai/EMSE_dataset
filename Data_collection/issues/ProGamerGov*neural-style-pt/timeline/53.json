The models never actually learn anything themselves, as they're completely frozen. It also takes about a second at most to load all the images into the model, so you aren't really going to gain anything speed wise as well. Some of the parameters also rely on manipulating an image before it's stored inside the model (content/style layers).\r\n\r\nFast style transfer is an offshoot of regular style transfer. It trades quality and flexibility for speed (once you've spent time training the model with specific parameters).

This will always create a quality tradeoff as the newly trained model is more general.\r\n\r\nOne interesting path I'm not sure if anyone has tried is to train a fast-style model on multiscale generated pictures instead of single scale.
