Thank you so much for your reply; I really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nI _think_ I understand this now...but please correct me if I'm wrong. \r\n\r\nSo you need to use the multiple GPU strategy for high-resolution style transfers because individual GPUs don't normally have enough memory to do the inference? If you have a GPU with lots of memory (for example a NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB of memory) you might be able to complete a render at a high resolution on that GPU without needing to use the multiple GPU strategy? But if you _do_ need to use multiple GPUs you can split the processing (and therefore the memory usage) over multiple GPUs but there will be a decrease in speed and an increase in memory usage from using that strategy?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/comments/855830070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RobertGoacher","id":34238874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM4ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34238874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher","html_url":"https://github.com/RobertGoacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGoacher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4851262610,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDg1MTI2MjYxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/events/4851262610","actor":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-07T11:03:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4851262614,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ4NTEyNjI2MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/events/4851262614","actor":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-07T11:03:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
