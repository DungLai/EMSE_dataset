multiple GPUs is now possible! Though I am not sure how I am going to deal with the feval function in a more elegant way. I am also not sure what if any change the new code will have on neural-style-pt's speed, because it will have redundant `to.(device)` inside the feval function when using only a single device.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to use both multiple GPUs and the CPU at the same time, or just a single GPU and the CPU at the same time. But I believe that will require some sort of conversion between tensor types in order to work. \r\n\r\nDue to this ability to use multiple CPUs and GPUs, I renamed the `-multigpu_strategy` parameter to `-multidevice_strategy`.

Nice work adding this support. It's unclear if you're still seeing the input image issue, but I was never able to invest much time into figuring out multigpu pytorch so I'm of no help here. I like the multidevice strategy idea, that's clever.\r\n\r\nFollowing this chain [1] and [2], is it possible that the gpu 0 usage is the cuda driver allocation when loading pytorch? I think a really useful feature would be to add a background nvidia-smi watcher with a high sample rate that could produce a plot of the memory usage, the native pytorch utils apparently don't do well [2]. There is a spike in the beginning of the program that isn't captured by the steady-state memory usage and it can be large enough to crash the program. It might also be useful in the dev/debug phase to determine what program is running on each gpu. I was never able to capture that entire memory usage profile (with the spike) in lua but maybe pytorch makes it easier using a library like [3]\r\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I've use python but something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport time, threading, nvgpu, numpy\r\n\r\n# 2d memory array for each gpu\r\n# each column is a gpu and each row is a memory percentage sample\r\n# for 50 samples on an 8 gpu machine, dimensions should be 50x8\r\nmemorySamples = []\r\n\r\n# time sampled every 250 ms or so.\r\nt = []\r\n\r\ndef updateGpuPlot():\r\n    # map the gpu info array onto an array of the memory use percentages.\r\n    memorySample = map(lambda mem: mem.mem_used_percent, nvgpu.gpu_info())\r\n    numpy.concatenate(memorySamples, memorySample)\r\n    t = t.append(time.time_ns() // 1000000) \r\n\r\n    threading.Timer(0.25, updateGpuPlot).start()\r\n```\r\nYou could also try disabling gpu 0 and seeing what breaks.\r\n\r\n[1]

I figured it out! It was actually something that I have suspected initially, but I didn't make the connection until I saw the note here: \r\n\r\n> [If you need to move a model to GPU via .cuda(), please do so before constructing optimizers for it. Parameters of a model after .cuda() will be different objects with those before the call.](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#constructing-it)\r\n\r\nI was converting my input tensors to cuda before running them though my model with: `tensor.type('torch.cuda.FloatTensor')`.
