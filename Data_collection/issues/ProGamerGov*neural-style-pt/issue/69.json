I know with other implementations that AVG pooling type always requires same amount of memory and would not fail once it starts, MAX pooling requires about ~25% more, and would fail on some combination of images and styles at a point it overflows","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
