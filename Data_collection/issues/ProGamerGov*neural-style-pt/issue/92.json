The intention would be that once it finished stylising item 1 in the list it automatically starts processing item 2, item 3 etc etc.. I know this would mean creating some kind of loop but I don't have the technical knowhow to set it up. I image it would have to be some kind of shell script similar to the starry_stanford.sh file in the scripts folder","closed_by":{"login":"jamahun","id":27876895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODc2ODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27876895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun","html_url":"https://github.com/jamahun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamahun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
