I have managed to install Python 3.7, Anaconda and Pytorch but I'm stuck at running \"python models/download_models.py\" because I don't know where to run it. If I run it in Python 3.7 I get a syntax error, and running it in Anaconda gives this error: \r\n\r\n(base) C:\\Users\\User>python models/download_models.py\r\npython: can't open file 'models/download_models.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\r\n\r\nAlso I don't understand the usage part, it just tells you that this is how you use it:\r\n\r\npython neural_style.py -style_image <image.jpg> -content_image <image.jpg>\r\n\r\nWhere do you type this line?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
