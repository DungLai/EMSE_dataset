In the past I was using cysmiths nerual style tf transfer which stopped working for the new titan RTX card I put in.  I see similarities in what you guys have done and have been testing your version with much joy (planning on doing a blog post about some settings I found useful).\r\n\r\nAnyhow I was wondering if we could use this for video some how because some of the video style transfer stuff out their is 4-5 years old and use optical flow and deepmatching which is mainly cpu intensive and any gpu ones dont see to work with the system.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on anyone using your code to create videos? is the seed value what I would need to render out various frames along with maybe nvidias new optical flow system or?\r\n\r\nAnyhow thank you again!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/519563/95515944-4c3eb880-0973-11eb-841f-45f7cee8fd4d.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
