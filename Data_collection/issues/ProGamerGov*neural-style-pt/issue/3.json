Glad to see you're still working on neural-style.  Very much intrigued by the PyTorch implementation, so I dropped a copy on my windows box to play around with.  \r\n\r\nI was curious if you've continued to experiment with scaling and producing high resolution output and how you may have gone about achieving that with the PyTorch implementation.  Any differences to report?  Any changes in the GPU memory ceilings / resolution limits?  Any new scaling scripts to share?","closed_by":{"login":"ProGamerGov","id":10626398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov","html_url":"https://github.com/ProGamerGov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProGamerGov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
