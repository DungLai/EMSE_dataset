I then reverted the dataset reader to the original version `v1` to compare outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# fr_gsd conllu output files\r\n1b5016fa8ce46578c853035dac673b7b  pred_fr_gsd.conllu\r\n1b5016fa8ce46578c853035dac673b7b  pred_fr_gsd-v1.conllu\r\n\r\n# en_ewt conllu output files\r\n9b4560573aa4a5057b83fe9057749128  pred_en_ewt.conllu\r\n9b4560573aa4a5057b83fe9057749128  pred_en_ewt-v1.conllu\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then downloaded the `udify-model.tar.gz` model from Lindat and predicted with the original `v1` and updated dataset reader:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# fr_gsd conllu output files\r\n9369a87a7502f64054ff2b7ba125ea25  udify_pred_fr_gsd.conllu\r\n9369a87a7502f64054ff2b7ba125ea25  udify_pred_fr_gsd-v1.conllu\r\n\r\n# en_ewt conllu output files\r\nd2189dfdfef3487606de4e4350bac676  udify_pred_en_ewt.conllu\r\nd2189dfdfef3487606de4e4350bac676  udify_pred_en_ewt-v1.conllu\r\n\r\n# Accordingly, the JSON results files are also the same:\r\nd9899d7d68a7f63cf4684d757031dea8  udify_pred_fr_gsd.json\r\nd9899d7d68a7f63cf4684d757031dea8  udify_pred_fr_gsd-v1.json\r\n```\r\nSo I think that it should be safe enough to make these changes without breaking the code, though users may need to install the latest `conllu` version to use `parse_incr`:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install -U conllu\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will submit the PR now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/comments/600741805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jbrry","id":22963704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTYzNzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22963704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry","html_url":"https://github.com/jbrry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"jbrry","id":22963704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTYzNzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22963704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry","html_url":"https://github.com/jbrry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbrry/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-18T16:59:29Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T16:59:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Hyperparticle/udify/pull/13","id":583869100,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzkwNTUyODAx","number":13,"title":"Utilize
