From what I understand, [parser.py](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/udify/blob/master/udify/dataset_readers/parser.py) contains some source code from the conllu library with a few modifications, mainly to handle multi-word tokens, where the desired output (example from `fr_gsd-ud-train.conllu`) looks like:\r\n```\r\nmultiword_ids ['3-4', '72-73', '87-88', '105-106', '110-111', '121-122']\r\nmultiword_forms ['du', 'des', 'des', 'des', 'du', 'du']\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my forked version, I am still using the conllu library to return the annotation but do the MWT processing in a subsequent step in a `process_MWTs` function. In this version, I confirmed that the outputs are the same:\r\n```\r\nmultiword_ids ['3-4', '72-73', '87-88', '105-106', '110-111', '121-122']\r\nmultiword_forms ['du', 'des', 'des', 'des', 'du', 'du']\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have done another few checks to make sure the data is the same, where *updated* is the forked version and *original* is the current version e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat fr_gsd_original/vocabulary/tokens.txt | md5sum\r\ne80f1f1e341fc5734c8f3a3d1c779c55 \r\ncat fr_gsd_updated/vocabulary/tokens.txt | md5sum\r\ne80f1f1e341fc5734c8f3a3d1c779c55\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a few benefits I can see from this:\r\n1. Supports most recent `conllu` library.\r\n2. Reduces the amount of code needed in `parser.py`\r\n\r\nThere are probably more elegant ways of going about MWT processing but I just thought I'd post it here in case you find it helpful. If you do, I can do more tests and once confirming behaviour is exactly the same, I can submit a PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/12/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"KoichiYasuoka","id":15098598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDk4NTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15098598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka","html_url":"https://github.com/KoichiYasuoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoichiYasuoka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T09:13:00Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T09:13:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr/issues/58","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr/issues/58/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr/issues/58/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr/issues/58/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr/issues/58","id":643893216,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDM4OTMyMTY=","number":58,"title":"allennlp==1.0.0
