Since the release of the UDify code, AllenNLP also has added a [multilingual UD dataset reader](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/allennlp/data/dataset_readers/universal_dependencies_multilang.py) and a [multilingual dependency parser](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/allennlp/models/biaffine_dependency_parser_multilang.py) with a [corresponding model](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/training_config/multilang_dependency_parser.jsonnet), which should make things easier.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of things that need to be done:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add scripts to download and concatenate the UD data for training/evaluation. Also, add the CoNLL 2018 evaluation script.\r\n- [ ] Create a UDify conllu -> conllu predictor that can handle unseen tokens and multiword ids.\r\n- [ ] Add the sqrt learning rate decay LR scheduler.\r\n- [ ] Add optional dropout to [ScalarMix](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/allennlp/modules/scalar_mix.py).\r\n- [ ] Modify the multilingual UD dataset reader to handle multiword ids.\r\n- [ ] Add lemmatizer edit script code.\r\n- [ ] Modify the [BERT token embedder](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/allennlp/modules/token_embedders/bert_token_embedder.py) to be able to return multiple scalar mixes, one per task (or alternatively all the embeddings). Add optional args for internal BERT dropout.\r\n- [ ] Add generic dynamic masking functions.\r\n- [ ] Add the custom sequence tagger and biaffine dependency parser that handles a multi-task setup.\r\n- [ ] Add the UDify main model, wrapping the BERT, dynamic masking, scalar mix, sequence tagger, and dependency parser code. Provide custom metrics for TensorBoard.\r\n- [ ] Add utility code to optionally cache the vocab and grab UD treebank names from files.\r\n- [ ] Add helper script to evaluate conllu predictions and output them to json.\r\n- [ ] Add tests to verify the new UDify model and modules.\r\n- [ ] Add UDify config jsonnet file.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/5/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
