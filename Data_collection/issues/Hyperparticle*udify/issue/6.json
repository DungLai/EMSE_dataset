If it's still not showing this, then there might be something off about your training.\r\n\r\nOne caveat is that if you use a subset of treebanks for fine-tuning instead of all 124 UD v2.3 treebanks, *you must modify the configuration file*. Make sure to tune the learning rate scheduler in your config to the number of training steps. Copy the [`udify_bert_finetune_multilingual.json`](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/udify/blob/master/config/ud/multilingual/udify_bert_finetune_multilingual.json) config and modify the `\"warmup_steps\"` and `\"start_step\"` values. A good initial choice would be to set both to be equal to the number of training batches of one epoch (run the training script first to see the batches remaining).","closed_by":{"login":"Hyperparticle","id":8497170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTcxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8497170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle","html_url":"https://github.com/Hyperparticle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hyperparticle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
