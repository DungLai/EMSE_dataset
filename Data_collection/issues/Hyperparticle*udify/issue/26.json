My goal is not to calculate evaluation metrics, at the moment, but rather have my pretrained model give me predictions on dependencies to hopefully get a head start with dependency annotations. I am working on an underdocumented language and would like to have a first row of dependencies predictions that I would then go back to, verify and update to create the GOLD standard for my language.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason my input file have to conform to the conllu format other than for evaluation metrics? My issue seems to be that my \"head\" and \"deprel\" columns are not integers but simply \"_\" because they're empty. I would preferably like to keep the .conllu format of my input file as it contains POS information already which could give me better predictions. \r\n\r\nThank you for the research,  it's super helpful, especially for underdocumented languages.\r\n\r\nHere is my error message : \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49000319/136022036-7fd08e30-6b91-4e96-8afc-040e06c5bdd3.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lmompela","id":49000319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDAwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49000319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela","html_url":"https://github.com/lmompela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmompela/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Hyperparticle/udify/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
