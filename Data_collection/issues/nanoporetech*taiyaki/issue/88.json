Is there a way to obtain this information? \r\n\r\nI am using the flags ```--filter_mean_dwell 2 --filter_max_dwell 30``` - the mean dwell corresponds to the median of the  mean dwell obtained from sampling at the beginning of training (2.09). I experimented with increasing the max dwell since it solved the problem in issue #22 , but setting it to 30 is no more than an educated guess. Is there any way to obtain more accurate parameters? \r\n\r\nI am aware of the scripts in /misc, but I am a computer scientist by training and have a hard time interpreting the plots. \r\nI am happy to provide more details, if necessary. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nKatja ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/88/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/88/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
