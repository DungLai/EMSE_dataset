Thank you for providing it on an open forum. \r\n\r\nDuring my analysis of some data and comparing it with the results generated using Guppy, I have come to find some issues.\r\n- The posterior to basecall process is quite slow with only the CPU, (works great on the GPU). I also had issues with running it in parallel using Multiprocessing using Python.\r\n- The basecalls generated by Taiyaki seem to be close to Guppy but not exactly equal.\r\n\r\nSo, as a solution, I was wondering If we could somehow use the [Fast CTC Decoder](https://github.com/nanoporetech/fast-ctc-decode), which is very fast even on the CPU, to speed up the process.\r\n\r\nAlso, I also needed some help in understanding the posteriors that the models generates.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nPrateek Singh\r\nPhD student\r\nComputational Biology","closed_by":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/97/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/97/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
