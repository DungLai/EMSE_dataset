Does it mean windows of 19 bases are used for training (and thus later for basecalling)? \r\n\r\n`  --winlen WINLEN       Length of window over data (default: 19)`\r\n\r\nI'm asking, because I've trained a model for RNA using _in vitro_ transcribed RNA molecules (IVT) that cover all possible 5-mers. The model works great both, on the training and test set (Fig1), but it doesn't work on RNA isolated from cells (Fig2), while default guppy3 model works just fine (Fig3). \r\nWould setting `--winlen 5` (thus training to detect 5-mers) solve the issue?\r\n\r\n**Fig1: In vitro transcribed sample [guppy3 using model trained on IVT]**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/988152/60093672-59b63c00-974a-11e9-890e-9624f308173d.png)\r\n\r\n**Fig2: Biological sample [guppy3 using model trained on IVT]**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/988152/60093487-db599a00-9749-11e9-9841-4bc1635bc49d.png)\r\n\r\n**Fig3: Biological sample [guppy3 with default model]**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/988152/60093632-35f2f600-974a-11e9-9645-b55e8d8b4dbb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, could you please briefly describe also how chunks.hdf5 was generated for _ab inito_ training?
