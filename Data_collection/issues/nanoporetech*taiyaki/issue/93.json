There is no pre-training in this process. I am basically referring to `train_flipflop.py`\r\n- When running `train_flipflop.py`, is there any way to specify where to save the training folder? Right now it just creates the folder in the directory where the script is called. If one wants to train multiple models in parallel one has to run the script from different folders. Perhaps something that could be implemented in the future.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"marcpaga","id":35224321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjI0MzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35224321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga","html_url":"https://github.com/marcpaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
