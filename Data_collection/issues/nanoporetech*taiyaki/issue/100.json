We have also sequenced the same plant species on the MinION on R10.3 flowcell and scussefully trained a model with those data. However, when running guppy with that model we get the following error:\r\n\r\n```$ guppy_basecaller -i ../r10_min/raw/all/ -s basecalls_new -c /opt/ont/guppy/data/dna_r10.3_450bps_hac.cfg -m ../r10_min/model.json --device 'cuda:1 cuda:2'\r\nONT Guppy basecalling software version 3.4.5+fb1fbfb\r\nconfig file:        /opt/ont/guppy/data/dna_r10.3_450bps_hac.cfg\r\nmodel file:         ../r10_min/model.json\r\ninput path:         ../r10_min/raw/all/\r\nsave path:          basecalls_new\r\nchunk size:         1000\r\nchunks per runner:  512\r\nrecords per file:   4000\r\nnum basecallers:    1\r\ngpu device:         cuda:1 cuda:2\r\nkernel path:        \r\nrunners per device: 4\r\n\r\n[guppy/error] main: Unknown activation: swish\r\n[guppy/warning] main: An error occurred in the basecaller.

If so, which version of guppy would we need?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, after reading https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki#guppy-compatibility , do we need to adapt our training to be compatible with guppy?","closed_by":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
