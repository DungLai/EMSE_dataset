Does needs to specify a motif(like CCWGG of 5mc in E.coli) for Training a modified base model ?If my modified base does not exist any motif,this pipeline will still work?\r\n2. I have some confuse about `trim` parameter.I think this parameter is used to limit a range of reads for downstream analysis.For insdance,There is a read consisting of 100 bases.If I set `--trim 80 20` ,only the data in the interval (20th bases~80th bases)will be used.\r\n3. How to quickly and accurately change content of references.fasta for each read.If I know the UUID of the reads and the location where the modification exists,I want to alter the canonical base to modified base at  known sites.（e.g ACCGT**A**GTGAT --> ACCGT**X**GTGAT）","closed_by":{"login":"weir12","id":37523816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTIzODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37523816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12","html_url":"https://github.com/weir12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
