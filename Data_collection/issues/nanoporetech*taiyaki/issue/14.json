Additionally our cluster has limited GPU nodes so I'd like to make some documentation which encourages users to not carry out the portions of a Taiyaki workflow that do not use the GPUs (I think this includes `generate_per_read_params.py` and `prepare_mapped_reads.py`). I'd like to install Taiyaki globally. I made a script using sed to edit the \"venv\" destination and did some testing, but I get an error message: \r\n\r\n`pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'taiyaki==4.1.0' distribution was not found and is required by the application`\r\n\r\nIs this because I have only the \"venv\" and not other dependencies in the git repo?\r\n\r\nAny advice or suggestions would be appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"drwhitehouse","id":8874233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse","html_url":"https://github.com/drwhitehouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
