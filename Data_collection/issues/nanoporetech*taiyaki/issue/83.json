I wonder how the neural network is trained on sequences of this sizes as it is too long for RNNs (any type of RNN to my understanding as back propagation will vanish). Are the sequences cut at some point and if so at which length and how did you came to this solution?\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDean","closed_by":{"login":"DeanH10","id":67422002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDIyMDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67422002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10","html_url":"https://github.com/DeanH10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/83/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/83/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
