Every other step completed relatively quickly. Here's my command below:\r\n```\r\n$ prepare_mapped_reads.py --jobs 8 {per_read_data.tsv}  {mapped_signal_file.hdf5} {model} {ref_per_read.fasta}\r\n```\r\nI know I can use the ```--limit``` flag and plan on incorporating it on the re-run, but almost feel like that's just wasted potential for the amount of data we could be training Guppy with. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know way to incorporate a GPU to accelerate the read preparation step? Is that even possible?","closed_by":{"login":"Linkrw12","id":19381237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgxMjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19381237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12","html_url":"https://github.com/Linkrw12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linkrw12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
