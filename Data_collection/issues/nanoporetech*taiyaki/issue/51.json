If you use the `--fast5_out` option, guppy will write modification probabilities back to the fast5s that you basecalled. There aren't any tools yet, so you will have to extract this information yourself using hdf5 or h5py. You are looking for a dataset called `ModBaseProbs`. Please open another issue if you need more help with guppy's mod-bases output.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @myrtlecat in https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/26#issuecomment-501310444_\r\n\r\nI've generate a model for RNA modification of my choice. I am having issues with basecall.py script running out of memory when encounters large read. If I were to dump the model to json file for guppy, will the fast5_out record these probabilities? Or is still only for DNA m5C and m6A?
