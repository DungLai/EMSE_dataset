I restarted the training job from the last checkpoint and this failed (due to memory issues) around 40,000 iterations.\r\n\r\nI have one comment and one question:\r\n- When starting from a previous checkpoint the training just starts from iteration 1 again. Wouldn't it make sense to start from the last iteration point? i.e. isn't that the point of the checkpoint?\r\n- Given neither of these jobs successfully completed, but combined they are greater than the stop condition of 50,000 iterations, can I just use the last checkpoint from the most recent job as my final model?","closed_by":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/78/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/78/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
