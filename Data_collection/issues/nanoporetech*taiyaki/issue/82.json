I would really appreciate if you could help me out. \r\n1.\tWhat is the main purpose of taiyaki? If it is just to basecall can’t we just use guppy and be done. Why are we doing BAM of Mapped Basecalls, Extract per-read Reference, Create Per Read Scaling parameters, training model and using guppy again?  [Walkthrough]\r\n-\tAre we suppose to use one set of our data to train and then apply our training to other sets of data.\r\n2.\tIn the modified base walkthrough, under the creating mapped read file we use pretrained/r941_dna_minion.checkpoint. Are we suppose to create this file when we are running our data or its inbuilt and we are just inserting it. If we are creating this data, how do we that.\r\n3.\tDo I have to pay to install guppy? If not could you let me know how. I have been being redirected to nanopore site where it tells me you have to pay to download the software.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Your help is very much appreciated. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"techsavy12","id":67298681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mjk4Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67298681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12","html_url":"https://github.com/techsavy12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techsavy12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
