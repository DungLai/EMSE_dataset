Could only work out how to install CUDA 10.1 so changed makefile accordingly to TORCH_CUDA=10.1 and CUPY_10.1=cupy-cuda101 ) and now the makefile seems happy pulling down and installing all the dependencies until it gets to pysam. \r\nIt consistently falls over trying to make a pip wheel for pysam (see install terminal text attached). \r\nAny ideas ?. Is it pointing to the correct pysam repository in the makefile?. Is changing to 10.1 version of CUDA causing issues ?\r\nAny help massively appreciated\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n[install_script.txt](https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/files/3793081/install_script.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nNick ","closed_by":{"login":"myrtlecat","id":1001949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat","html_url":"https://github.com/myrtlecat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
