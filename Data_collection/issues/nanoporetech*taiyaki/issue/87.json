More precisely, I am wondering how to properly choose ground truth for the signal chunks. As I understand from other github issues, the chunks are pieces chosen randomly from the read. It is not clear to me, however, how the corresponding ground truth is identified. Do you simply use the corresponding segment of the ground truth, e.g., if the signal chunk contains the first 10% of the read, you choose the first 10% of the ground truth to go with it? I would assume, that this approach introduced errors due to slight misalignment?\r\nI would be glad, if you could shed some light on this process. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nKatja ","closed_by":{"login":"katjahauser","id":20944728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTQ0NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20944728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser","html_url":"https://github.com/katjahauser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/87/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
