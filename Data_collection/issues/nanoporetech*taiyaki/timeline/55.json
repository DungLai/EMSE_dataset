Our usual guideline is that a training set should contain at the very least 1 megabase of unique sequence, e.g. 1000 distinct PCR products each 1kb in length. Ideally though you would use much more data than this.\r\n\r\nEven if you do train a model, there is no guarantee it will perform better than the models in guppy (which are trained using taiyaki, btw). If you are having issues with guppy I suggest asking on the community for advice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/543082198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myrtlecat","id":1001949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat","html_url":"https://github.com/myrtlecat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2720496332,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjcyMDQ5NjMzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/2720496332","actor":{"login":"myrtlecat","id":1001949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat","html_url":"https://github.com/myrtlecat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-17T09:08:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
