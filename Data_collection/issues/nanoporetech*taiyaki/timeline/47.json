validation methods are certainly applicable to validate modified base output. The issue in this case (I am guessing) is the ground truth. In order to obtain these metrics a ground truth must exist. In the case of modified bases, ground truth data sets are more difficult to produce confidently. Thus to expand on my first sentence, given a per-read ground truth standard machine learning metrics are applicable.\r\n\r\nTo clarify just a bit further, for modified bases it is important to compare metrics only within the same data set. It is often the case that ground truth modified base data sets are very sparse (1 modified base for every 100-10k canonical bases). Comparing these metrics across different datasets should, in general, not be done.\r\n\r\nOne final issue here is that mapping these modified base calls to a reference can be tricky. In order to address this issue we have released the [megalodon package](https://github.com/nanoporetech/megalodon), which uses a taiyaki modified base model to call modified bases more accurately by anchoring the intermediate basecalling results to a reference. In addition, megalodon includes a script to produce the standard machine learning metrics mentioned (see [here](https://github.com/nanoporetech/megalodon/blob/master/scripts/validate_results.py)). Note though that megalodon does not currently support direct RNA data, but this is a goal under current development.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/523545241/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2582960895,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU4Mjk2MDg5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/2582960895","actor":{"login":"weir12","id":37523816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTIzODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37523816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12","html_url":"https://github.com/weir12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-26T08:40:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
