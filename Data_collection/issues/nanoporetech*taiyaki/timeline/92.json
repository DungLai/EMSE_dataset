5 hours, if you have sufficient RAM and CPU.\r\n\r\nDid you see a progress indicator (rows of coloured dots) at all?\r\n\r\nUsing the commands in the walk-through, I get the following times on a

A machine with insufficient resources might suffer and a major slow-down would be apparent.  In these circumstances, the data could be prepared in batches by splitting up `input_strand_list` then merged using the `misc/merge_mappedsignalfiles.py` utility (this can also be used to split the mapping over several machines).\r\n\r\nWhen preparing your own data, it is important to know that the preparation scales very badly (quadratic) with the length of reads and most of the runtime will be spent on a few reads. Setting the `--max_read_length` flag to filter out long reads is helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/685893303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/686368343","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/92#issuecomment-686368343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/92","id":686368343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjM2ODM0Mw==","user":{"login":"marcpaga","id":35224321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjI0MzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35224321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga","html_url":"https://github.com/marcpaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcpaga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T09:25:55Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T09:25:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the detailed answer! This is very helpful. I think the problem is on my end, while the CPU and RAM should not be a problem, hard drive access is a bit slow, so reading all those reads might be the issue here.\r\nJust to add a bit in case it is useful for someone else, I had already filtered long reads.
