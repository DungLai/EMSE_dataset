The preparation step for training, which maps the signal from each read to an appropriate reference, deals with whole reads.  The training process then samples batches of fixed-length chunks from these mappings, the chunk length varying between batches.  We've found that training with varying chunk lengths produces base calling models that generalize well to long reads providing the average chunk length is long enough.  \r\nOn the base calling side, the Guppy software cuts up reads into fixed-length chunks and then stitches the resulting sequences together.  The result of splitting then stitching has a similar accuracy to base callers, like https://github.com/nanoporetech/flappie, that deal with whole reads, but enables much higher performance to be achieved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/649597980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3486374466,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ4NjM3NDQ2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/3486374466","actor":{"login":"DeanH10","id":67422002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDIyMDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67422002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10","html_url":"https://github.com/DeanH10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T12:20:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
