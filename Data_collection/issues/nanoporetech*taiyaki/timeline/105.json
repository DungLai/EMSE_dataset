When I was using prepare_mapped_reads.py a few months ago, it would launch all the processes, but only one or two would actually be active. I have some ideas as to why this might be the case, but haven't had time to investigate. As a work around I did a quick and dirty modification to significantly boost the value of \"chunksize\" in \"bin/prepare_mapped_reads.py\". A \"chunksize\" value of 1000 or more resulted in 100% use of all the allocated threads, though it took a while to get them all started (I was using a lot more than 8 threads).

I ended up using the ```--limit``` flag and ended up training only using a subsection of data. This still allowed me to train Guppy and get decent val loss, so I'm content. I could always play around with more flag options to incorporate more data, so I'll close the issue.
