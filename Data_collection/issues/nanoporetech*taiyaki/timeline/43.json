Thus these must contain the exact sequence which that raw signal should be \"signal mapped\" against (aka re-squiggled). At the `get_refs_from_sam.py` stage of training, only those reads that were mapped will have reference sequence extracted (and included in the output file to be included in training). \r\n\r\nThus following the standard training walkthough, only mappable reads are processed through to training. If one wanted to include un-mappable reads in a training data set, a method would have to be devised in order to process these reads in order to obtain a ground truth sequence. Given this procedure, the produced per-read references could then be passed on to the `prepare_mapped_reads.py` stage of training.\r\n\r\nI believe this is in agreement with your interpretation in this issue description, but hopefully this wording will helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/523536993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/527361933","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/43#issuecomment-527361933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/43","id":527361933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzM2MTkzMw==","user":{"login":"callumparr","id":41637575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjM3NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41637575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr","html_url":"https://github.com/callumparr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T08:35:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T08:35:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank you for your kind explanation.
