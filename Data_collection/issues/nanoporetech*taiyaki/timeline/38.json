found subtle differences between the two approaches,by comparing the reference sequence of each read.\r\nReversing (not complement)the per-read references generated by  `get_refs_from_sam.py` and replacing **T** with **U**.This is going to be equal to the result of my custom method.So I think the two approaches are similar in essence. \r\nHowever,I found the **true sequences** obtained by these two methods are inconsistent with the sequences of reads themselves(generated by GUPPY).Perhaps this is due to the high error rate of Nanopore
