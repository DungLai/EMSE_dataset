Can you confirm that you are able to train a model from the example data provided using your set-up please?  We have concerns about your use of CUDA 10.1 (ref: https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/9#issuecomment-497329823) since PyTorch 1.0 only supports CUDA 10.0, and this may be connected to the memory issues from PyTorch that you are reporting.\r\n\r\nThe next step for debugging would be to see if you can train a normal (mod-base unaware) model, all modifications being transcoded to their canonical bases.  If your training sequences have a sufficiently rich content, and were prepared with an appropriate pre-trained RNA model, this should produce an adequate base caller.  The model parameterisation we used for training RNA models is very different from the defaults, fitted for DNA, the example model for `abinitio` training is parameterised like:\r\n* `--size 96`\r\n* `--stride 12`\r\n* `--winlen 31`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/498248344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/498327573","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/23#issuecomment-498327573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/23","id":498327573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODMyNzU3Mw==","user":{"login":"lpryszcz","id":988152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODE1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/988152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz","html_url":"https://github.com/lpryszcz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lpryszcz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-03T16:23:23Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T16:23:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, I'll give a try to unmodified mode.
