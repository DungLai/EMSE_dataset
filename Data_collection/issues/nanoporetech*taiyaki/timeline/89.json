The `upgrade_model.py` is for upgrading old Taiyaki checkpoints and enforces consistency requirements that back-converting a Guppy model does not meet.  For this reason, the `json_to_checkpoint.py` unsupported and exists in repository as a guide in case this facility is needed again in the future. \r\n\r\nChanging the activation in a trained model will likely break it, particularly since tanh and swish have very different responses to their input.  Also many layers, particularly the recurrent layers like GRU and LSTM, are reliant on Nvida's libraries and these do not currently support the swish activation function.  \r\n\r\nWhat is your use case?  You may better off altering one of `models/mGRU_flipflop.py` or `models/mLSTM_flipflop.py` and training from scratch.  Alternatively, you could start with one of the checkpoints distributed with Taiyaki;  if neither of these are appropriate, we can probably provide you with one that is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/677477511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/680785047","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/89#issuecomment-680785047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/89","id":680785047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDc4NTA0Nw==","user":{"login":"DeanH10","id":67422002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDIyMDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67422002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10","html_url":"https://github.com/DeanH10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeanH10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-26T10:02:21Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T10:02:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello \r\nfirst of all thank you for your response, it cleared a couple of things up for me. \r\n\r\nOverall my goal is to improve the basecalling accuracy of Guppy by, ultimately, diversifying its trainingdata and/or altering the neural network accordingly.
