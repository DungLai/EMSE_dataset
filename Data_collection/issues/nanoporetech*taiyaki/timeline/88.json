I added the option --full_filter_status. I have some questions regarding the output, though. (I am ignoring the humongous loss for now.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1 3994396005111112829050552320.00000 3999999865392247241231564800.00000  15.66s (232.96 ksample/s 115.56 kbase/s) lr=1.00e-04 pass:1338  tooshort:14431  maxdwell:352  meandwell:955\r\n[...]\r\n2 4054432639104744519574224896.00000 3999999865392247241231564800.00000  16.71s (266.04 ksample/s 132.00 kbase/s) lr=1.00e-04 pass:3088  tooshort:29074  maxdwell:718  meandwell:2104\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease correct me, if I'm wrong -- I assume that tooshort, maxdwell and meandwell indicate the number of reads filtered due to not matching a minimum length, having been in the pore for too long and deviating from the mean dwell too much, respectively. Also, the number of filtered reads is accumulated from output to output. \r\n\r\nGiven how many reads are rejected due to being too short, I will look into the data again in greater detail. However, I am already using data that passed a number of quality checks -- could you briefly explain how the threshold for a read being too short is set? If, e.g., reads that lie more than X std. deviations below the mean were rejected, the many rejections I am seeing could also be caused by some very long reads distorting the mean. Since the distribution of read lengths *is* asymmetrical and somewhat heavy-tailed towards longer reads -- the mode is at about 40k signals/read, but reads up to a length of 200k-250k signals are still common -- this might be an explanation. \r\nIn general, are very unevenly distributed read lengths an issue for Taiyaki? If so, do you have any rule of thumb as to how much diversity Taiyaki can still deal with? \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nKatja ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/678116959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"katjahauser","id":20944728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTQ0NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20944728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser","html_url":"https://github.com/katjahauser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
