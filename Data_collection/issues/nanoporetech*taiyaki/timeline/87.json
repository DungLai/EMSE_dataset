the script train_abinitio.py is designed for the situation where we have data which consists of pairs (**signal_vector**, **base_sequence**), but we don't know the mapping. In other words, we don't know which element of a signal vector corresponds to which base in the sequence.\r\n\r\nThis sort of data set might be obtained if we sequence a sample which consists entirely of many copies of forward reads of the same (usually fairly short - a few hundred bases) sequence. In this case all the **base_sequence**s are the same.\r\n\r\nThis would often be the first step in understanding and modelling a new pore design or new experimental set-up for the sequencing system.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the method you suggest, taking the first 10% of each read and the first 10% of each sequence, may work in some circumstances if the data is of high quality and there is not much variation in the speed. But there will always be some error because the speed at which DNA moves through the pore varies, and so the first 10% of samples will not correspond exactly to the first 10% of bases.\r\n\r\nThis 10% method may work well enough to train a not-very-good basecaller which can then be used to map further data for training using train_flipflop.py - but it might not!\r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question. It's hard to be more specific without knowing the details of your application.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/676604061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aevansNP","id":45230403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjMwNDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45230403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP","html_url":"https://github.com/aevansNP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/678095925","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/87#issuecomment-678095925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/87","id":678095925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODA5NTkyNQ==","user":{"login":"katjahauser","id":20944728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTQ0NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20944728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser","html_url":"https://github.com/katjahauser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katjahauser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T07:43:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T07:43:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi aevansNP, \r\n\r\nthis does answer my question and it clarifies when (not) to use the ab initio route.
