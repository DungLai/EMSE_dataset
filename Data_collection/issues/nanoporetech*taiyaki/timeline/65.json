Does the `basecall.py` script in Taiyaki work for you?\r\n\r\nNot all network architectures that Taiyaki can train are supported by Guppy out-of-the-box.  Some layers may not be implemented, some may only support specific sizes that specified at compilation time -- this probably the issue with the GRU layer with different input & output sizes.  Your first two architectures look like fairly simple changes from the default model, so there may be an issue with theLSTM JSON output and I'll investigate in the New Year.\r\n\r\nTo get a list of Guppy supported layers, the best place to ask will be the Guppy Devs on the Nanopore Community wiki.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/568892482/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/569018178","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/65#issuecomment-569018178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/65","id":569018178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTAxODE3OA==","user":{"login":"d05943006","id":22384763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg0NzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22384763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006","html_url":"https://github.com/d05943006","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d05943006/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-26T09:04:54Z","updated_at":"2019-12-26T09:04:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your reply!
