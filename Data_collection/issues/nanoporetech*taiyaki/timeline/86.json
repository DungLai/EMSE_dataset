Really appreciate it!\r\nI am new to the platform and I just wanted to make sure Iâ€™m understanding the process. I believe that in the per read reference in the walkthrough example the modification was represented as Z and Y. So when we are generating our training data using the methods you suggested (megalodon or pysam), we will be manipulating or generating files that would include the modified base in the form of  Z and Y for example in place of the canonical base.  Let me know if my understanding is right, if not could you provide me with more guidance.
