to train a model using all of them at once (or any subset of them). This will **sometimes** increase the speed of training compared to using a single GPU, but it's more complicated because data must be synchronised between the different devices. It looks like the MultiGPU script failed because it only found one CUDA-capable GPU on your system (by default it tries to use 2). If that seems incorrect (i.e. if you think you have at least 2 CUDA-capable GPUs) then the question is why can't pytorch correctly detect them? If that's the case then I suggest you open a new issue and we can help you to diagnose the problem (although the pytorch forums might be a better place to ask).

Sorry I didn’t reply earlier – I’ve been a way for a few days.\n\nYes, please shut this enquiry down.

This will *sometimes* increase the speed of training\ncompared to using a single GPU, but it's more complicated because data must\nbe synchronised between the different devices. It looks like the MultiGPU\nscript failed because it only found one CUDA-capable GPU on your system (by\ndefault it tries to use 2). If that seems incorrect (i.e. if you think you\nhave at least 2 CUDA-capable GPUs) then the question is why can't pytorch\ncorrectly detect them? If that's the case then I suggest you open a new\nissue and we can help you to diagnose the problem (although the pytorch\nforums might be a better place to ask). If you just have one GPU, then the\nMultiGPU script isn't relevant to you and you can just ignore it.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/58?email_source=notifications&email_token=ANUQWFDR7ZQ6ANBL5ZYBI5LQUPJDFA5CNFSM4JHHCZEKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOEEN64RQ#issuecomment-555478598>,\nor unsubscribe\n<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANUQWFCH7ZOLXD7BVLWPDT3QUPJDFANCNFSM4JHHCZEA>\n.[image: Image removed by sender.]\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/556991851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NickP-at-SBL","id":57215764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjE1NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57215764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL","html_url":"https://github.com/NickP-at-SBL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickP-at-SBL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
