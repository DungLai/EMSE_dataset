For `train_flipflop.py`, if `--device` is not given, or `--device cpu` is used, then training will be performed on the CPU; setting the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to an appropriate value will critical for achieving maximum performance here.  We highly recommend using a GPU since the difference in speed is about two orders of magnitude over CPU only.\r\n\r\nQueries about Guppy are best addressed to the appropriate forum.  I believe a CPU version of guppy is available, and the standard version may be capable of running in CPU only mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/656015848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
