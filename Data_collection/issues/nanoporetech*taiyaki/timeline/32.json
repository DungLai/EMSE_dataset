The training data also contains the sequence data that goes with the samples. That data (samples + bases that go with them) is a chunk.\r\n\r\nChunks must pass some tests (filters) before they are used in training. A chunk is rejected if the maximum dwell time (i.e. number of samples representing a single base) or mean dwell time (average samples per base) is outside a range determined by sampling done at the start of training.\r\n\r\nThese warning messages tell you that more chunks than expected are failing these filter tests. The reason could be that something has gone wrong in the biochemistry, or it could just be that the conditions in whatever experiment you are doing are more variable than in the tests we did to set up the code.\r\n\r\nTraining will still proceed with these warnings - it looks like about half the training data is failing the tests. You have the choice of carrying on as things are (excluding some of your training data, which will probably make training proceed more quickly because of lower data variability, but might mean that the more extreme data in your test set is basecalled less well), or relaxing the filter parameters to include the whole test set.\r\n\r\nYou might find the script misc/plot_mapped_signal_files.py helpful - you can use it to inspect the mappings in your training data file and see whether (for example) some of them look like they are particularly noisy or corrupted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/511871610/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aevansNP","id":45230403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjMwNDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45230403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP","html_url":"https://github.com/aevansNP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aevansNP/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2498477940,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ5ODQ3Nzk0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/2498477940","actor":{"login":"weir12","id":37523816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTIzODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37523816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12","html_url":"https://github.com/weir12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-22T03:04:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2498805515,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyNDk4ODA1NTE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/2498805515","actor":{"login":"weir12","id":37523816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTIzODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37523816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12","html_url":"https://github.com/weir12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-22T07:03:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/513667716","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/32#issuecomment-513667716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/32","id":513667716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzY2NzcxNg==","user":{"login":"weir12","id":37523816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTIzODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37523816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12","html_url":"https://github.com/weir12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T07:05:30Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T08:22:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm
