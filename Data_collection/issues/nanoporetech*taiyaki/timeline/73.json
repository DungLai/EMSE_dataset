@marcus1487 .  \r\nWhen you say \"signal mappings that are quite different from taiyaki\" what do you mean? Less or more accurate?  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have just randomly subsampled by reads to a more manageable amount and then I'll just use the rest for evaluation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/611913413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbhall88","id":20403931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAzOTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20403931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88","html_url":"https://github.com/mbhall88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbhall88/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3221021830,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIyMTAyMTgzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/3221021830","actor":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-10T07:18:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3221021833,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMjEwMjE4MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/3221021833","actor":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-10T07:18:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/612093191","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/73#issuecomment-612093191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/73","id":612093191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjA5MzE5MQ==","user":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-10T15:55:25Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T15:55:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Accuracy is hard to measure here. Taiyaki performs a squiggle space Viterbi mapping through the posteriors produced by the basecaller. Megalodon performs mappings by retaining the link between the signal, through basecalls and onto the reference mapping. Thus Megalodon mappings will contain any skipped bases in the base space mapping, while the Viterbi mapping done by Taiyaki will force all bases to be assigned to a segment of signal. These are different, but assessing accuracy of these signal assignment methods is difficult.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/612093191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/705449478","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/73#issuecomment-705449478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/73","id":705449478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTQ0OTQ3OA==","user":{"login":"organic-chemistry","id":29305032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzA1MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29305032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry","html_url":"https://github.com/organic-chemistry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/organic-chemistry/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-08T09:28:51Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T09:28:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, I tried to use your work around\r\n\r\n`megalodon h5rep --outputs signal_mappings  --reference myref.fa  --processes 6 --do-not-use-guppy-server  --taiyaki-model-filename ../taiyaki/models/mLstm_flipflop_model_r941_DNA.checkpoint --device cuda:0`\r\n\r\nit works but i get a lot of:  Likely out of memory error.
