Thanks your questions, hopefully the answers below are helpful.\r\n\r\n1.  Modifications donâ€™t need to be in a specific motif, but you do need to be able to annotate the modifications on a per-read basis.  For natural DNA, motifs and external comparisons, like bisulphite, help considerably in reducing the false-positive annotations; less of an issue for synthetic strands.\r\n2.  The trim parameter is in number samples not bases and is intended for helping to trim away signal from reads due the ONT adapter.  The mapping procedure itself also help trim the signal to the reference sequence provided.\r\n3.  This problem is suited to a custom script, probably using a regular expression.  An alternative approach is to keep two sets of references, one canonical and one marked up with modifications, find the matching coordinates for each read in the canonical reference then slice out the corresponding sequence from the modified reference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/506684930/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2449391519,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ0OTM5MTUxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/2449391519","actor":{"login":"weir12","id":37523816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTIzODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37523816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12","html_url":"https://github.com/weir12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weir12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-30T12:35:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2676775657,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI2NzY3NzU2NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/2676775657","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fad68a13c7dad946966ca3020a8a23a73702d7ee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/commits/fad68a13c7dad946966ca3020a8a23a73702d7ee","created_at":"2019-10-01T12:12:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
