you for your response. \r\nI've tested scrappie beforehand and the output produced by it was not reliable in terms of what I wanted to simulate. DeepSimulator has better prediction models and is more reliable, but only in case of the DNAseq (it lacks pretrained RNA models). This is why I decided to give a try to taiyaki. I'm not that skilled to design my own prediction model and implement it to DeepSimulator - so I asked this question. Well, thank you anyways!\r\n\r\nHave a nice day!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/717943248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nemitheasura","id":68285258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjg1MjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68285258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura","html_url":"https://github.com/nemitheasura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nemitheasura/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
