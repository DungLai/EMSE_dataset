It's not an error per se, but a warning which (in this case) you can safely ignore.\r\n\r\nThe `prepare_mapped_reads.py` script creates a data set for training a basecaller. The inputs to this script are a directory of reads (fast5 files) and a fasta file which should contain one reference sequence for each read. Each read has a unique ID that is used to match it up to the correct reference. The message you quoted is informing you that for some of the reads in the dataset, no corresponding reference sequence was found. In this case it's expected, because we only provided reference sequences for 5891 of the reads used in the walkthrough. There are 8000 reads in total, and we provided references for 5891, so 2109 are rejected.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons why reads might be excluded form the training set, which will generate messages similar to the one above. It is worth paying attention to these messages as they might indicate something has gone wrong, but in this case there is a simple explanation so it's safe to ignore it. In general if a few reads fail that's probably ok, but if they all fail something probably went wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/494861831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myrtlecat","id":1001949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat","html_url":"https://github.com/myrtlecat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myrtlecat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/494872484","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/17#issuecomment-494872484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/17","id":494872484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDg3MjQ4NA==","user":{"login":"drwhitehouse","id":8874233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse","html_url":"https://github.com/drwhitehouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drwhitehouse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T16:17:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T16:17:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks very much for your prompt response.

This script should certainly report a more useful error message if this is the case. \r\n\r\nAlternatively and if it fits your use case, megalodon basecall training dataset preparation may be a bit simpler. Takes only a single command to create a training dataset from raw fast5s and a reference.

the mapped bit of the reference sequence as the sequence which is provided to training for each read (as described in the Taiyaki walkthrough in a step by step fashion). Thus the provided sequences for training are extracted directly from the references for mapping. Thus the sequences provided for training are generally as accurate as the reference sequences themselves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/825038770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
