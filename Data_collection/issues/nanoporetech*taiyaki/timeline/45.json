Note that given appropriate training data the standard `mGru_flipflop.py` model can be trained to collapse modified bases to a desired canonical base.\r\n\r\nThus if the desired output is the specific detection of modified bases, then training should start from the `mGru_mod_cat_flipflop.py` model file. If the goal is to collapse modified bases to a desired canonical base, then training should begin with the standard `mGru_flipflop.py` model file.\r\n\r\nThus, this decision is independent of the entry point for training (either ab initio or full strand training). The standard or `mod_cat` model must be specified for either entry point. The purpose of the ab initio training is discussed more in the [docs](https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/blob/master/docs/abinitio.rst). Note that at the moment the ab initio training script is not currently compatible with the modified base model type, though this is a goal for future development.\r\n\r\nThe decision as to whether to combine the two data sets for training again relies on the goals for the trained model. If the model should be able to accurately base call canonical bases, then merging in the canonical data set would help this model toward this goal. If on the other hand the model will only be used to accurately base call strands composed of the modified base, then training from only the modified strands would be sufficient. Keep in mind that at the outset of training the models do not have any preference to identify canonical bases. This is only learned through training the model from the provided training data.\r\n\r\nThe final question is more simple. The parameters mentioned in the linked issue (#32) should be used from the outset of training. Once model training has started (as with the `mod_cat` model decision) these parameters cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nAt a higher level, training from a sample containing completely modified bases may not perform as desired in contexts outside of the training data type. To be more specific, if this model is tested against a sample with this modified base in isolation (or observed relatively sparsely) performance may be quite poor as the model was never trained with examples of this modification in isolation. This is not to say that obtaining a high confidence data set with modified bases introduced relatively sparsely is a simple task, but given this input data type expectations for performance outside of the training data type should be tempered appropriately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/523528796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcus1487","id":13755444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU1NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13755444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487","html_url":"https://github.com/marcus1487","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcus1487/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/524178644","html_url":"https://github.com/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/45#issuecomment-524178644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/45","id":524178644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDE3ODY0NA==","user":{"login":"callumparr","id":41637575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjM3NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41637575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr","html_url":"https://github.com/callumparr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumparr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-23T05:33:23Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T05:33:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the explanation.
