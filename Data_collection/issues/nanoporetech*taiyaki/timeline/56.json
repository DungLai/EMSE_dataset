We find that the Q scores obtained directly from trained models tend to be miscalibrated, a common issue in base calling going right back to capillary sequencing and the classic Phred papers.  \r\nOur released production models (Guppy) process the raw Q scores with calibration factors to ensure they are accurate, but these factors are model dependent.  We'll add a script to Taiyaki shortly to empirically determine factors for a Taiyaki-trained model, and update the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate model performance, I would always recommending looking at the accuracy of real reads when compared to a reference.  Preferably, those reads would be from a different run and sample than the training data.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: issues nanoporetech/flappie#41 &  #53 are connected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/comments/544411746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2747384782,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc0NzM4NDc4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/2747384782","actor":{"login":"hanyue36","id":8010327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTAzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8010327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36","html_url":"https://github.com/hanyue36","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyue36/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-28T06:18:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3993746386,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5OTM3NDYzODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/issues/events/3993746386","actor":{"login":"tmassingham-ont","id":19410440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDEwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19410440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont","html_url":"https://github.com/tmassingham-ont","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmassingham-ont/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7990df34d9c096cf2b76b18944a35d20665d69a5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nanoporetech/taiyaki/commits/7990df34d9c096cf2b76b18944a35d20665d69a5","created_at":"2020-11-13T14:35:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
