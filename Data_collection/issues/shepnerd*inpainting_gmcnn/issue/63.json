Is the model able to work with datasets where white (255,255,255) is part of the valid information of the image?\r\nFor what I understand from this part of the paper \r\n`an image X and a binary region mask M (with value 0 for known pixels and 1 otherwise)`\r\nand this part of the code \r\n`image = image * (1-mask) + 255 * mask`\r\nSuch a white space would be considered a hole and inpainted.\r\nIs there a way to bypass this? I was wondering if changing the mask from a binary to a RGB one similarly to the ones used in image segmentation would work. Another idea that comes to my mind is modifying the dataset and changing any pure white (255,255,255) for another white, like (254,254,254).\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
