Thank you for your excellent work.\r\nI have come across three problems and hope that you or the github community can provide me some insights.\r\n\r\n1.  I downloaded the pretrained model paris_streetview provided in the main page, which I unzipped and get the folder below\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17902928/75419149-2d555e00-5970-11ea-9eec-4b04f930d2a6.png)\r\n\r\nHowever , when i run the command to test this pretrained model as instructed\r\n```py\r\npython test.py --dataset paris_streetview --data_file ./test.txt --load_model_dir ./checkpoints/paris-streetview_256x256_rect --random_mask 0\r\n```\r\nAn error would occur:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17902928/75419265-6c83af00-5970-11ea-9de9-b9b64fec305f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if the model i downloaded is somehow damaged?(If so, could you kindly send a pretrained model to my e-mail 294484601@qq.com for that it's hard for me to access google drive) Or that I've done something wrong elsewhere?\r\n\r\n2. How many images are there in your training datasets? What's the  optimal number of training image? I tried to train the network on Adobe FiveK dataset that contains 5000 images of various scenes and portraits. Is that too many or too few training images?\r\n\r\n3. To what value should the loss converge on the pretrain phase and fine-tune phase respectively?\r\n\r\nYour prompt response is highly appreciated. Thank you for your time, and wish you all the best!\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
