Now I want to test with my own image. My image already has some hole present. It is given [in this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xzr9d6NmL_Hyk8wvQ7N5KWWDbr_2tLGS/view?usp=sharing) \r\n\r\nAccordingly I tried modifying your code by eliminating the following portion from your test.py file\r\n`if h >= config.img_shapes[0] and w >= config.img_shapes[1]:`\r\n            `     h_start = (h-config.img_shapes[0]) // 2`\r\n           `      w_start = (w-config.img_shapes[1]) // 2`\r\n            `     image = image[h_start: h_start+config.img_shapes[0], w_start: w_start+config.img_shapes[1], :]`\r\n        \r\n\r\n`else:`\r\n            `     t = min(h, w)`\r\n            `     image = image[(h-t)//2:(h-t)//2+t, (w-t)//2:(w-t)//2+t, :]`\r\n            `     image = cv2.resize(image, (config.img_shapes[1], config.img_shapes[0]))`\r\n`image = image * (1-mask) + 255 * mask`\r\n\r\n I want only to fill the holes in the images through your code. I already have images in which holes are present . Kindly say how to do the same?\r\n\r\nI can visualize that I need to apply mask on the portion to be refilled and then run the session, but how to do the same?\r\nHere is the portion I guess I need to change but I wonder how?\r\n` for i in range(test_num):`\r\n        `if config.mask_type == 'rect':`\r\n            `mask = generate_mask_rect(config.img_shapes, config.mask_shapes, config.random_mask)`\r\n        `else:`\r\n            `mask = generate_mask_stroke(im_size=(config.img_shapes[0], config.img_shapes[1]),\r\n                                        parts=8, maxBrushWidth=24, maxLength=100, maxVertex=20)`\r\n\r\nTHANKS in advance.
