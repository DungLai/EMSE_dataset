The `StyleLoss` class is never used\r\n3. The `ContentLoss` class is never used (Seems that these two losses are merged into `IDMRFLoss`?)\r\n4. The `TVLoss` class is never used\r\n5. The re-construct loss and auto-encoder loss are both `L1Loss`, seems that there are no these two losses in the paper\r\n\r\nThe `VGG19` class is also never used, replaced by vgg19 in torchvision. (Is there any difference between the two VGG?)\r\n\r\nAnd, if in stroke mode, `self.gt_local = self.gt`, `self.completed_local = self.completed`. So the global and local net in `self.netD` are just receiving the same input, do the same thing, and produce the same output.
