Do you have any suggestions on how to improve it? Will they improve if i retrain your  512x680 model using 512x512 images? My assumption is that 256x256 images were used in training 512x680 model(might be wrong, kindly correct) , because when i set input tensor to size 256*256 given the same image (after resizing of-course) for inpainting then results are good.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage chosen from internet randomly\r\n![img_02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37732181/66893002-81d1ef80-f006-11e9-9828-8e819645add6.png)\r\n Inpainting results\r\n![oie_KbTS5qcU8rKM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37732181/66893092-b2198e00-f006-11e9-9c13-553597039f2c.png)\r\n\r\ninpainting result when input tensor is set to 256*256, on the same resized image\r\n![007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37732181/66893446-8945c880-f007-11e9-98a5-b74abc915943.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"farazBhatti","id":37732181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzMyMTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37732181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti","html_url":"https://github.com/farazBhatti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
