Could you please explain the motivation for the value range of discriminator outputs and respective loss?\r\n\r\nHere is my understanding:\r\nThe step of evaluation of 'realism' for inpainted and ground truth images is ([here](https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/blob/ba7f7109c38c3805800283cdb9d79cd7c4a3294f/pytorch/model/net.py#L304), excluding the local terms for brevity):\r\n\r\n`self.completed_logit, _ = self.netD(self.completed.detach(), self.completed_local.detach())`\r\n`self.gt_logit, _ = self.netD(self.gt, self.gt_local)`\r\n\r\nwhere  `self.completed_logit`  and `self.gt_logit` are outputs from the last linear layer of the discriminator and these contain a single value for each image in the batch. \r\n\r\nSo the discriminator does mapping `[b, c, h, w] --> [b, 1]`. This part is clear, except for the range of output values which might be arbitrary due to the [linear activation in the last layer of discriminator](https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/blob/ba7f7109c38c3805800283cdb9d79cd7c4a3294f/pytorch/model/net.py#L184). So it might be -3, 5, 0.3, etc.\r\n\r\nThe loss term is defined [as follows](https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/blob/ba7f7109c38c3805800283cdb9d79cd7c4a3294f/pytorch/model/net.py#L308):\r\n`self.D_loss = nn.ReLU()(1.0 - self.gt_logit).mean() + nn.ReLU()(1.0 + self.completed_logit).mean()`\r\n\r\nAs I understand, a perfect discriminator should assign  anything **above 1 to real image**, `self.gt_logit` (identifies the ground truth as real) and anything **less than -1 to fake image**,  `self.completed_logit` (identifies the inpainted image as fake).\r\n\r\nIs that correct? If so, could you explain what is the practical difference in using these compared to regular 0 and 1 adversarial ground truths like [here](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN/blob/a163b82beff3d01688d8315a3fd39080400e7c01/implementations/pix2pix/pix2pix.py#L131)?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"ovcharenkoo","id":10777713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzc3NzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10777713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo","html_url":"https://github.com/ovcharenkoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovcharenkoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/51/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/51/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
