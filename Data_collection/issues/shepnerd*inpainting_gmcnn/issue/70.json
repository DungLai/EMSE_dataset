I tried converting this repository model to Tensorflow 2x step by step. I think everything was fine, but when training and testing the model the results were not very satisfactory. So, maybe there is a problem with my conversion that I can't find it. I tried to train the model on a small subset of OpenImages V6. The principal parameters that I used (sorry, because names can be slightly different than yours):\r\n\r\n--img_size 256x256x3\r\n--batch_size 4\r\n--learning_rate 1e-4\r\n--gaussian_steps 7\r\n--gaussian_kernel_size 32\r\n--gaussian_kernel_std 20.0\r\n--reconstruction_loss_weight 1.2\r\n--adversarial_loss_weight 0.001\r\n--gradient_penalty_loss_weight 10\r\n--id_mrf_loss_weight' 0.03\r\n--nn_stretch_sigma 0.5\r\n--id_mrf_style_weight 1.0\r\n--id_mrf_content_weight 1.0\r\n\r\nI pretrained the model with only confidence reconstruction loss for the recommended steps, and results for this phase seem fine.\r\n\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39574343/111080389-8aca3780-84fe-11eb-8726-35875be2fc20.png)\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39574343/111080394-8ef65500-84fe-11eb-9689-7641eeb1b8bb.png)\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39574343/111080399-9289dc00-84fe-11eb-8967-8ce61940f97f.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, in the training phase, after some steps, the results do not seem to converge and eliminate the mask.\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39574343/111080418-adf4e700-84fe-11eb-8c9c-821f1f21d99c.png)\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39574343/111080424-b3523180-84fe-11eb-8a23-86b391a47052.png)\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39574343/111080428-b816e580-84fe-11eb-8602-0f25e6cee8cd.png)\r\n\r\nI would like to know if you have any idea of what could be happening, or you have experienced any similar issue.
