I want to train on my own dataset. What should be the full command for training given that my data is in `Tensorflow/images/` directory with respect to the already provided sample \r\n`python train.py --dataset [DATASET_NAME] --data_file [DATASET_TRAININGFILE] --gpu_ids [NUM] --pretrain_network 1 --batch_size 16`\r\n\r\nWhat is the dataset-trainingfile in this case? What is the use of giving the dataset name?\r\n\r\nAlso, after testing a few days ago I found that inpainting for rectangular type mask is not good, What is the reason?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/509013406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djongpo","id":52217535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjE3NTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52217535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo","html_url":"https://github.com/djongpo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djongpo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/509054057","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/22#issuecomment-509054057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/22","id":509054057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTA1NDA1Nw==","user":{"login":"shepnerd","id":5066504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5066504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-08T02:07:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T02:07:59Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The dataset-trainingfile is a file containing the image paths which are used for training, e.g., a file named as train.txt with the following contents:\r\n```\r\n/data/download/face/1.png\r\n/data/download/face/2.png\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe given dataset name is used for creating checkpoints.\r\n\r\nAbout the inpainting rect mask with our method, our method performs well and stably on the datasets with a few categories (like face and streetview), but still has difficulties dealing with large-scale datasets with thousands of diverse object and scene categories, such as Places2. This is also given in the limitation of our paper.\r\n\r\nYour mentioned inpainting performance problem mainly caused by: 1. insufficient and imbalanced training data: each category has around 0.4k~3k images, and it's obviously not enough for fitting a complex categories like campus. This may be lessened by other regularities like the popular non-local / self-attention or normalization modules. 2. Limited model capacity: compared with image synthesis tasks, our used model capacity is much smaller.
