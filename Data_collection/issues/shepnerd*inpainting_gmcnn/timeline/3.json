When s is *not equal* to value in div, the code is OK.\r\n>    3. When s is *equal* to the value in div, as the paper said, div\r\n>    should exclude this value first, then find another suitable value.\r\n>\r\n> But the code didn't handle the condition when s is *equal* to the value\r\n> in div and didn't exclude it. Is this a small bug in the code or\r\n> something wrong in my understanding ?\r\n>\r\n> Hope I described it clearly.\r\n>\r\n> —\r\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n> Reply to
