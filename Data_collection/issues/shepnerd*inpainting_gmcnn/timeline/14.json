The given implementations (priority_loss_mask in inpaint_ops.py [tensorflow] or ConfidenceDrivenMaskLayer in layer.py [pytorch]) can work both on regular or irregular mask. The idea of this spatial variant mask weight (or confidence-driven mask) is to propagate the confidence of the known pixels to the unknown ones by Gaussian smoothing in an iterative manner. The difference of using this on regular and irregular masks is to apply different setups of the parameters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/485798431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shepnerd","id":5066504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5066504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/486489153","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/14#issuecomment-486489153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/14","id":486489153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjQ4OTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"SunHu1","id":32833890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32833890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1","html_url":"https://github.com/SunHu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T01:50:34Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T01:50:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your reply,I got it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/486489153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SunHu1","id":32833890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32833890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1","html_url":"https://github.com/SunHu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2298905706,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI5ODkwNTcwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/events/2298905706","actor":{"login":"SunHu1","id":32833890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32833890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1","html_url":"https://github.com/SunHu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunHu1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-25T01:50:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
