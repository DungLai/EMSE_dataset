Using a network with more capacity and training it with a large size\nmask and more time.\n2. If you wanna recover less semantically sensitive regions (e.g.,\ngrassland, sky, and rocks), you can consider applying contextual attention\nmodule or non-local module to the bottleneck of the generator. They work\nwell for even large missing regions.\n3. If you are using masks generated by stokes, sparse convolution (or\npartial convolution) and gated convolution will be helpful. Meanwhile, you\ncan consider removing adversarial training and replace l1 loss with\nperceptual loss.\n\nPrerna Garg <notifications@github.com> 于2019年4月1日周一 下午3:55写道：\n\n> I tried testing your code on masks of large sizes and the output is quite\n> bad.
