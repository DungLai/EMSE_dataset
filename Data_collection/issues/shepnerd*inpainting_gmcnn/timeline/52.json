Thanks for pointing out. \r\nFor your question 5, the used reconstruction loss is intrinsically l1 loss. The difference between our used reconstruction loss and the common one is ours are incorporated spatial variance.\r\nThe code about the VGG19 class is also unnecessary. It will be removed. Thanks for pointing out.\r\nFor your last question, yes, using one discriminator is fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/575105843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shepnerd","id":5066504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5066504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2954290752,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk1NDI5MDc1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/events/2954290752","actor":{"login":"jinyu121","id":7346324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDYzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7346324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121","html_url":"https://github.com/jinyu121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinyu121/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-16T12:08:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
