Your mentioned white (255,255,255) in the input in our given images are just for visualization (like ` image = image * (1-mask) + 255 * mask`). The input of the inpainting model is just the image (RGB) and the mask (binary), and the model will try to repair the regions indicated by the mask.\r\n\r\nFor your later mentioned issue, I am not sure I get your

You can just convert the input gray (8 bit) image into a color (24 bit) one first then process it. For opencv, you can read the gray images as color ones if using the default parameters.\r\n\r\nWhether it can repair the gray images well depends on the training data. Anyway, you can try the pretrained model first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/684422516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shepnerd","id":5066504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5066504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
