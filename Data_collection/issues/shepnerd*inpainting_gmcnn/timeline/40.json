your religious mural dataset contains portraits, that will be quite challenging. In your case, I guess proper data augmentation (e.g. multi-scale, flip, etc.) or applying some non-parametric methods would help (e.g. attention based layers or methods. They are good at regularizing the ill-posed optimization). From my perspective, learning-based methods relies heavily on the training data, and only perform well when the distribution of testing data is close to the former. When the given training data is complex and diverse, a sufficient training quantity is vital, or using any practical regularizations / priors we induce from the
