Compared with standard deconvolution, it generates less artifacts usually. For the feature maps produced by different branches, they are upsampled by bilinear, which gives smoother predictions compared with nearest-neighbor upsampling.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/540559889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shepnerd","id":5066504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5066504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/542013451","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/35#issuecomment-542013451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/35","id":542013451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjAxMzQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"WMCh","id":5831068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzEwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5831068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh","html_url":"https://github.com/WMCh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WMCh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T02:54:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T02:54:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your reply.
