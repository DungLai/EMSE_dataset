@nywang2019 can you please explain how does gan generate image..?\r\n\r\nWhat i know about GAN: there is a discriminator and generator, discriminator differ from fake and real image, and generator generate new images till discriminator cannot find difference between original and fake image.\r\n\r\nEven both use CNN algorithm in the model.\r\n\r\nMy question how gan performs object removal..??\r\n\r\nLets say for example i have added a mask near eye region where it has wrinkle, and clicked the complete button. \r\n\r\nWhen image is generated how it is generated without wrinkle...?\r\n\r\nOne of actual process of the GAN which i know is, ATTGAN, where to generate smiling image for non-smiling image, it gather smiling facial expression from dataset/model trained, then it apply those smiling expression to the image given as input.\r\n\r\nIn case of GMCNN, how does model select mask area and then make it wrinkle free.\r\nwhat is actual thing that tells these changes need to be applied to the mask region\r\n\r\nLets assume i have a face image with some pimple i applied mask and it removed pimples from image, how it was able to generated image without pimples.\r\n\r\nCan you please tell me what are internal process of GAN, how all this work. \r\n@nywang2019 @shepnerd \r\n\r\nThanks

short, GAN-based inpainting methods predict the user-marked regions based on image context.\r\n\r\nIn your given example (remove pimples from face images), with the input image and the annotated region, the model infers the semantics (e.g. skin, eye, etc.) and low-level details (e.g. color, texture, etc.) of the marked region from the unknown regions (context), and composes the final result. The prediction of the semantics (whether it contains pimples or not in your example) is from the given image context and the learned priors from the training set. Thus, the final predicted region is highly likely to be different from the corresponding one of the ground truth, as the final model optimization goal is to encourage the prediction to be realistic just as the training data.\r\n\r\nFor your mentioned ATTGAN, it has extra conditions as attribute vectors. With that, the GAN model can interactively control its prediction. Similar works or ideas can be referred to pixel2pixel and its following works.\r\n\r\nAbout the quick understanding of the GAN-based inpainting methods, you can treat the GAN loss as a learnable metric.  It measures how real the prediction is (compared with the real data) from a high-level perspective (similar to human observers) instead of requiring pixel-wise similarities like L1 or L2 loss. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/572066630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shepnerd","id":5066504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5066504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/comments/689811983","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/36#issuecomment-689811983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/issues/36","id":689811983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTgxMTk4Mw==","user":{"login":"qwerdbeta","id":36677267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Njc3MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36677267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta","html_url":"https://github.com/qwerdbeta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwerdbeta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-09T20:45:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T20:45:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a similar problem but instead of making the images and masks smaller, I made them 512x512 (images) and 256x256 (masks) and I get a similar error with different numbers reported.
