This can lead for example to always stopping after first epoch if patience=1.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nYou can train a model with early stopping and patience=1 and see that it always stops after first epoch. Or you can use the unit test below that I added to pull request.\r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\n```python\r\nfrom unittest.mock import MagicMock, PropertyMock\r\n\r\nfrom catalyst.core import EarlyStoppingCallback\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_patience1():\r\n    \"\"\"@TODO: Docs. Contribution is welcome.\"\"\"\r\n    early_stop = EarlyStoppingCallback(1)\r\n    runner = MagicMock()\r\n    type(runner).stage_name = PropertyMock(return_value=\"training\")\r\n    type(runner).valid_metrics = PropertyMock(return_value={\"loss\": 0.001})\r\n    stop_mock = PropertyMock(return_value=False)\r\n    type(runner).need_early_stop = stop_mock\r\n\r\n    early_stop.on_epoch_end(runner)\r\n\r\n    assert stop_mock.mock_calls == []\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nTraining doesn't stop after first epoch. And the unit test passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n```bash\r\nCatalyst version: 20.06\r\nPyTorch version: 1.5.1\r\nIs debug build: No\r\nCUDA used to build PyTorch: None\r\nTensorFlow version: N/A\r\nTensorBoard version: 2.2.2\r\n\r\nOS: Mac OSX 10.15.5\r\nGCC version: Could not collect\r\nCMake version: version 3.8.0\r\n\r\nPython version: 3.7\r\nIs CUDA available: No\r\nCUDA runtime version: No CUDA\r\nGPU models and configuration: No CUDA\r\nNvidia driver version: No CUDA\r\ncuDNN version: No CUDA\r\n\r\nVersions of relevant libraries:\r\n[pip3] catalyst-codestyle==20.4\r\n[pip3] catalyst-sphinx-theme==1.1.1\r\n[pip3] efficientnet-pytorch==0.6.3\r\n[pip3] numpy==1.18.5\r\n[pip3] segmentation-models-pytorch==0.1.0\r\n[pip3] tensorboard==2.2.2\r\n[pip3] tensorboard-plugin-wit==1.6.0.post3\r\n[pip3] tensorboardX==2.0\r\n[pip3] torch==1.5.1\r\n[pip3] torchvision==0.6.1\r\n[conda] catalyst-codestyle        20.4                      <pip>\r\n[conda] catalyst-sphinx-theme     1.1.1                     <pip>\r\n[conda] efficientnet-pytorch      0.6.3                     <pip>\r\n[conda] numpy                     1.18.5                    <pip>\r\n[conda] segmentation-models-pytorch 0.1.0                     <pip>\r\n[conda] tensorboard               2.2.2                     <pip>\r\n[conda] tensorboard-plugin-wit    1.6.0.post3               <pip>\r\n[conda] tensorboardX              2.0                       <pip>\r\n[conda] torch                     1.5.1                     <pip>\r\n[conda] torchvision               0.6.1                     <pip>\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/854/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/854/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
