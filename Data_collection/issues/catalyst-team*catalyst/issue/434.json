your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWhen initializing SupervisedRunner, you can set many useful parameters: `input_key`, `output_key` and `input_target_key`.\r\n\r\nHowever, with ConfigAPI, the Runner [is imported and initialized](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/scripts/run.py#L76) without parameters:\r\n```python\r\nExperiment, Runner = import_experiment_and_runner(Path(args.expdir)\r\nrunner = Runner()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this, unfortunately, we have to create new classes, like\r\n```python\r\nclass ModelRunner(Runner):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__(input_key=\"image\", output_key=None)\r\n\r\n# or even worse\r\nclass ModelRunner(Runner):\r\n    def predict_batch(self, batch: Mapping[str, Any]):\r\n        output = self.model(batch[\"image\"])\r\n        return output\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is bad to create a class that differs only in the parameters for initialization, so there is an idea.\r\nAdd the ability to write `RUNNER_PARAMS` (naming is not critical) in the` __init__.py` file and catch it when importing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# in `__init__.py`\r\n\r\nfrom catalyst.dl import SupervisedRunner as Runner\r\nRUNNER_PARAMS = dict(input_key=\"image\", output_key=None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when `catalyst-dl run` is executing\r\n```python\r\nExperiment, Runner, runner_params = import_experiment_and_runner(Path(args.expdir)\r\n\r\nrunner_params = runner_params or {}\r\nrunner = Runner(**runner_params)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
