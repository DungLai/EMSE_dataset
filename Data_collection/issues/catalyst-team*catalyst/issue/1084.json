ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nI would catalyst to have an implementation of GeM(Generalized Mean Pooling) as proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02512.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nWell I like to use catalyst's contrib features very much and it has an amazing set of pooling methods available(GlobalMaxPool2d , \r\nGlobalConcatPool2d ,etc). I think that an implementation of GeM pooling will be a nice addition to the pooling module of catalyst.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nGoes without saying that I will work on this implementation myself","closed_by":{"login":"Atharva-Phatak","id":42376808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzc2ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42376808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak","html_url":"https://github.com/Atharva-Phatak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Atharva-Phatak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1084/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1084/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
