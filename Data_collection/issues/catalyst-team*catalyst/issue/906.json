üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nTensorboardLogger in batch logger mode displays horizontal axis by samples, which is inconvenient. \r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\n1. import logger\r\n`from catalyst.dl.callbacks import TensorboardLogger`\r\n2. make TensorboardLogger callback  with batch logger mode\r\n`calback_tb = TensorboardLogger(metric_names=[\"loss\"], log_on_batch_end=True)`\r\n3. add callback into runner\r\n`\r\nrunner.train(model=model,\r\n    criterion=criterion,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    callbacks=[calback_tb])\r\n`\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\nIn Tensorboard i have that plot:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-08-06

show amount of batches. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### How to fix \r\nTo fix it, you can change the step parameter in
