found a strange behavior\r\nWhen I tried to check my pipeline, by overfitting (I'm used BatchOverfitCallback), I got a strange result (image), my metric on train dataset was instable\r\nMy dataset created is only once (im checked that), im found the reason for this behavior.\r\nBecause every time, when we creating a data loader, we put true value to shuffle parameter, if the sampler is None and the dataset has a name train. This is wrong, because, we will not get overfitting, because every time we will get an absolutely random batch\r\nLink to bug:  https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/0a2afda0e90425c206f3ece3a28e347cb58278d3/catalyst/utils/loaders.py#L304\r\nAnd when I replace this, to false constantly I was able to get overfit\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17113191/101518838-7d4b6180-3993-11eb-83f0-1578f552e66c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17113191/101518857-82101580-3993-11eb-9338-a11d1deeca16.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1025/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
