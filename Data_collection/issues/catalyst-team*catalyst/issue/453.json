All, \r\n\r\nThanks for sharing this project !  Really enjoying playing with it. \r\nI have a question regarding multiprocessing and cohabitation between Catalyst framework and MPI.\r\nI have some code that uses CMAES and MPI to dispatch the work to different worker. I use that to learn low level controllers to be used in combination with RL controller. \r\n\r\nTo launch my CMAES optimization I do something like this : \r\n\r\n`mpirun -hostfile hostfile /home/jkr/run_mpi -n 28 -g 1000 -t CMAES -c checkpoints/checkpoint_155.pkl`.\r\n\r\nThen the mpirun wrapper dispatches the python controller. Know I noticed that Catalyst uses multiprocess to do multiprocessing. \r\n\r\nI noticed that multiprocessing is used in those files : \r\n\r\n```\r\ncatalyst/utils/parallel.py:9:from multiprocessing.pool import Pool\r\ncatalyst/rl/core/trajectory_sampler.py:4:import multiprocessing as mp\r\ncatalyst/rl/core/sampler.py:13:import multiprocessing as mp  # noqa E402\r\ncatalyst/rl/utils/buffer.py:4:import multiprocessing as mp\r\ncatalyst/rl/scripts/run_samplers.py:11:import multiprocessing as mp  # noqa E402\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess that it is mainly the `run_samplers.py` that would need to be adapted since its the process actually running the environment. What effort would it require to make Catalyst compatible with mpirun ? I am happy to work on a pull request if somebody is interested, I know that catalyst uses a db, so I guess that is how the samplers sends information to the trainer. Is this correct ? Any high level information would help me !\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
