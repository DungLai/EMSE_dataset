backend of catalyst to `agg`, which requires user to click to close the visualization window. I think it would be better if it is kept in original matplotlib backend.\r\n\r\nplease make a test before allowing the pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. run first script, in PyCharm with Catalyst installed Env.\r\n2. run second script, in PyCharm with Catalyst installed Env.\r\n3. make comparison\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well --> \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\n<!-- \r\nIdeally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. \r\nMinimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. \r\nYou could use minimal examples - https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples.\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimage = np.random.random([800,800,3]) * 255.0\r\nplt.imshow(image)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom catalyst import dl, utils\r\nfrom catalyst.data import ToTensor\r\nfrom catalyst.contrib.datasets import MNIST\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimage = np.random.random([800,800,3]) * 255.0\r\nplt.imshow(image)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\nIn pycharm, it supposed that the image should pop up in the SciView window, but after importing catalyst packages, it doesn't appear, after commenting the `matplotlib.use(\"Agg\")`, unexceptional behavior disappeared.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [ x ] bug description\r\n- [ x ] steps to reproduce\r\n- [ x ] expected behavior\r\n- [ x ] environment\r\n- [ x ] code sample / screenshots\r\n  \r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [ x ] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [ x ] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [ x ] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [ ] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"penguinflys","id":29662741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjYyNzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29662741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys","html_url":"https://github.com/penguinflys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinflys/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1270/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
