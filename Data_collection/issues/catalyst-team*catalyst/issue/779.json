However, VS builds are default on Windows systems for python.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the `crc32c` module is necessary at all. For example, there's some crc32 functionality in the `binascii` module, e.g.:\r\n```python\r\nimport binascii\r\nbuf = open(\"my_file.zip\",\"rb\").read()\r\nprint( binascii.crc32(buf))\r\n```\r\nWouldn't it be sufficient?
