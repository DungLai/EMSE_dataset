ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nAdd multi-node support to Catalyst\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nCatalyst currently doesn't support multi-node (several separate machines) training, only single-machine multi-gpu training. It limits Catalyst usability for some hardware setups. Also, as pytorch has mulit-node support, this change would require minimal changes in Catalyst code\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n1) Add nnodes and node_rank argument support to process_group_kwargs\r\n2) Add a check to make sure both arguments are present or none is\r\n3) Change attribute naming in code to make obvious distinction between local and global rank\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nWe can try to introduce 1.9.0+ pytorch elastic training but it will require more changes in code and break backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] feature proposal description\r\n- [x] motivation\r\n- [x] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1276/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
