That would be helpful to dump not only the configs, code, checkpoints, etc., but also traced model in order to save some time.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n<!-- Please outline the motivation for the proposal. Is your feature request related to a problem? e.g., I'm always frustrated when [...]. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link here too -->\r\nI am a bit lazy person, so I prefer automatise everything in order to do nothing :) \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nCallback will look onto metric we will provide and trace the model based on the value of this metric.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nAlternative is a manual tracing which is already implemented.","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/788/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
