/path/to/log/configs/_config.json which gives problems during model tracing using the function `trace_model_from_checkpoint`.\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Comment the line `from .experiment import Experiment` in `examples/cifar_simple/__init__.py` (otherwise you will get the error \"AssertionError: Experiment is set both in code and config.\")\r\n2. `cd examples`\r\n3. `catalyst-dl run --config ./cifar_simple/config_experiment.yml`\r\n4. Then run `catalyst-dl trace ./logs/cifar_simple/` -> get error \"TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable\"\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--#### Code sample--> \r\n<!-- Ideally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. \r\nMinimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\nTracing doesn't give an error; parameters are written to _config.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nPlease copy and paste the output from our environment collection script\r\n```bash\r\nCatalyst version: 20.11\r\nPyTorch version: 1.7.0\r\nIs debug build: Yes\r\nCUDA used to build PyTorch: 10.2\r\nTensorFlow version: N/A\r\nTensorBoard version: 2.4.0\r\n\r\nOS: Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia\r\nGCC version: (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0\r\nCMake version: version 3.10.2\r\n\r\nPython version: 3.8\r\nIs CUDA available: Yes\r\nCUDA runtime version: Could not collect\r\nGPU models and configuration: GPU 0: GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER\r\nNvidia driver version: 450.80.02\r\ncuDNN version: Could not collect\r\n\r\nVersions of relevant libraries:\r\n[pip3] catalyst==20.11\r\n[pip3] catalyst-codestyle==20.6.1\r\n[pip3] catalyst-sphinx-theme==1.1.2\r\n[pip3] efficientnet-pytorch==0.6.3\r\n[pip3] numpy==1.19.4\r\n[pip3] segmentation-models-pytorch==0.1.2\r\n[pip3] tensorboard==2.4.0\r\n[pip3] tensorboard-plugin-wit==1.7.0\r\n[pip3] tensorboardX==2.1\r\n[pip3] torch==1.7.0\r\n[pip3] torchvision==0.8.1\r\n[conda] catalyst                  20.11                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] catalyst-codestyle        20.6.1                   pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] catalyst-sphinx-theme     1.1.2                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] efficientnet-pytorch      0.6.3                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] numpy                     1.19.4                   pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] segmentation-models-pytorch 0.1.2                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] tensorboard               2.4.0                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] tensorboard-plugin-wit    1.7.0                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] tensorboardx              2.1                      pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] torch                     1.7.0                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] torchvision               0.8.1                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS\r\n- [x] I know, that I could [join Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1003/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
