It's consistent, but it's definitely confusing for many new users.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nUse these functions/classes:\r\nCallbacks\r\n* [`MeterMetricsCallback`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/core/callback.py)\r\n  * I'm not sure if this can support meters with softmax? Need to double check\r\n\r\nCriterion // Dependents\r\n* [`dice`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/utils/criterion/dice.py)\r\n  * [`DiceCallback`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/callbacks/metrics/dice.py)\r\n  * [`DiceLoss`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/contrib/nn/criterion/dice.py)\r\n* [`f1_score`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/utils/criterion/f1_score.py)\r\n  * [F1ScoreCallback](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/callbacks/metrics/f1_score.py)\r\n* [`iou`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/a7154b8d37b7368f6984c23df309069d22cd32fd/catalyst/utils/criterion/iou.py#L9)\r\n  * [`IoULoss`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/contrib/nn/criterion/iou.py)\r\n  * [`IouCallback`]()\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nShould ideally apply argmax when `activation='Softmax2d'`\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
