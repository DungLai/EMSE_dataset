ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nENUMs for the catalyst-based conventions.\r\nAs an example, I will use `scope`. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nWe have a lot of callbacks that used `scope` and maybe some other parameter that has only in catalyst-based meaning.\r\nAnd every time we need to do something like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif isinstance(scope, str) and scope in [\r\n            \"on_batch_end\",\r\n            \"on_batch_start\",\r\n            \"on_epoch_end\",\r\n            \"on_epoch_start\",\r\n        ]:\r\n            self.scope = scope\r\n        else:\r\n            raise TypeError(\r\n                'Expected scope to be on of the [\"on_batch_end\", \"on_batch_start\", \"on_epoch_end\", \"on_epoch_start\"]'\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nbut with ENUM we can do it like that\r\n\r\n```def __init__(... scope: SCOPE) -> None:```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
