the bug**\r\nNow the `_metrics.json` file created by [BaseCheckpointCallback](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/callbacks/checkpoint.py#L13) stores only the latest stage metrics (because the file is [simply overwritten there](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/callbacks/checkpoint.py#L30))\r\n\r\nWe need to make a normal metric manager for this checkpoint.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Add a config file with several training stages.\r\n2. Add a [CheckpointCallback](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/callbacks/checkpoint.py#L77) with `save_n_best` > 1 to store several best checkpoints (for example 3)\r\n3. In `logdir/checkpoints/_metrics.json` we have logs only for the last stage\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nMetrics are logged from all the stages.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
