ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\nFirst of all I'd like to add possibility to send images, segmentation masks to Wandb.\r\nAlso I want to fix small issue: WandbLogger has no possibility to pass name through Config API, it crushes.\r\nDescription of that bug at the bottom: #720\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nI need this functionality, this is my motivation :)\r\nAlso I don't see any possibility to log something except metric currently using Catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nI'd like to add such functionality to WandbLogger in order to log images (with or without masks) to Wandb.\r\nPart of the code could be copied from DrawMasksCallback. Something can be generalized and put out of these callbacks.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nI see no alternatives.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nResult examples:\r\nhttps://wandb.ai/stacey/deep-drive/reports/Image-Masks-for-Semantic-Segmentation--Vmlldzo4MTUwMw\r\n\r\nPS\r\n- [x] I know, that I could [join Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
