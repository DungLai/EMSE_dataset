Create script main.py with runner evaluation\r\n2. Create \\_\\_init__.py file in the same folder\r\n3. Set logdir=''\r\n4. Run script main.py\r\n5. Rerun script with PyCharm debugger\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThere are several ways to avoid that possible problem\r\n1. Change folder name from /code to something else\r\n2. Do not copy \\_\\_init__.py file into /code folder\r\n3. Show a warning that logdir='' might cause some problems\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
