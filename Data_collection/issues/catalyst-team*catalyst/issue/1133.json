üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nI have the following setup: \r\n* A dataloader that uses multiple workers \r\n* A model placed on a single GPU\r\n\r\nWhen running the code, I believe catalyst assumes that ddp is happening and places the data on multiple GPUs even though ddp was not set to True. This is a problem starting in version 21.03 (I confirmed that in 20.12 it is not a problem).\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior: run the following code sample on a machine with multiple GPUs and observe that the model is placed on all GPUs.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\nNote that I used a dummy dataset and model to illustrate the problem.\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nimport math\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom catalyst import dl\r\n\r\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"2\"\r\n\r\nBATCH_SIZE = 4\r\n\r\nclass MyIterableDataset(torch.utils.data.IterableDataset):\r\n    def __init__(self, start, end):\r\n        super(MyIterableDataset).__init__()\r\n        assert end > start, \"this example code only works with end >= start\"\r\n        self.start = start\r\n        self.end = end\r\n        self.length = end-start\r\n\r\n    def __iter__(self):\r\n        return (x for x in [i*torch.ones(2,requires_grad=False) for i in range(self.start, self.end)])\r\n\r\n    def __len__(self):\r\n        return self.length\r\n\r\ndef worker_init_fn(worker_id):\r\n    worker_info = torch.utils.data.get_worker_info()\r\n    dataset = worker_info.dataset  # the dataset copy in this worker process\r\n    overall_start = dataset.start\r\n    overall_end = dataset.end\r\n    # configure the dataset to only process the split workload\r\n    per_worker = int(math.ceil((overall_end - overall_start) / float(worker_info.num_workers)))\r\n    worker_id = worker_info.id\r\n    dataset.start = overall_start + worker_id * per_worker\r\n    dataset.end = min(dataset.start + per_worker, overall_end)        \r\n\r\nds = MyIterableDataset(start=3, end=100)\r\nmulti_cpu_data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, num_workers=4, worker_init_fn=worker_init_fn)\r\n\r\nloaders = {\"train\":multi_cpu_data_loader,\"valid\":multi_cpu_data_loader}\r\ndummy_model = torch.nn.Linear(2,1)\r\n\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(dummy_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)\r\ncriterion = torch.nn.L1Loss()\r\ntarget = torch.empty((BATCH_SIZE,1), dtype=torch.long).random_(5).cuda()\r\n\r\nclass CustomRunner(dl.Runner):\r\n   \r\n    def handle_batch(self, batch):\r\n        output = self.model(batch)        \r\n        loss = criterion(output,target[:output.shape[0]])       \r\n        self.batch_metrics.update({\"loss\": loss.clone().detach()})\r\n\r\n        if self.is_train_loader:\r\n            loss.backward()            \r\n            self.optimizer.step()\r\n            self.optimizer.zero_grad()\r\n\r\nrunner = CustomRunner()\r\n\r\n# model training\r\nrunner.train(\r\n    model=dummy_model,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    loaders=loaders,\r\n    logdir=\"../logs\",\r\n    num_epochs=2,\r\n    verbose=True\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe model should only use GPU 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nCatalyst version: 21.03\r\nPyTorch version: 1.7.1\r\nTorchvision version 0.8.2\r\nTensorFlow version: N/A\r\nTensorBoardX version: 2.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 16.04.6\r\nPython version: 3.7\r\nCUDA runtime version: 10.2\r\nNvidia driver version: 460.32.03\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x ] bug description.\r\n- [x ] steps to reproduce.\r\n- [x ] expected behavior.\r\n- [x ] environment.\r\n- [x] code sample / screenshots.\r\n- [x] I know, that I could [join Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
