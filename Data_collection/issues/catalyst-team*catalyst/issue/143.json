Here is the log\r\n\r\n```\r\n0/10 * Epoch (train): 100% 32/32 [00:41<00:00,  2.39s/it, _fps=11.486, loss=0.898] \r\n0/10 * Epoch (valid):   3% 1/32 [00:01<00:46,  1.50s/it, _fps=21.531, loss=1.656]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n....\r\nRuntimeError: CUDA error: out of memory\r\n``` \r\n\r\nMy model uses only 80% of GPU during training. However, in validation step, It is out of memory. That is so weired since I though validation consums less memory than training. \r\nI am not sure it is normal or not. But I guess, probably, GPU does not have time to release GPU before going to validation step. \r\n\r\nI also tried to add some callback to freeze GPU: \r\n```\r\nclass FreeGPU(Callback):\r\n\r\n    def on_stage_start(self, state):\r\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\r\n\r\n    def on_loader_start(self, state):\r\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\r\n\r\n    def on_loader_end(self, state):\r\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\r\n\r\n    def on_stage_end(self, state):\r\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\r\n\r\n    def on_epoch_start(self, state):\r\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\r\n\r\n    def on_epoch_end(self, state):\r\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\r\n``` \r\nIt does not help at all. \r\nDo you have any ideas?. \r\nP/S: It is not the first time I face to this problem. The only thing I can prevent it is reducing the batch size. But, It hurts the performance.","closed_by":{"login":"ngxbac","id":11550123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTUwMTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11550123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac","html_url":"https://github.com/ngxbac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
