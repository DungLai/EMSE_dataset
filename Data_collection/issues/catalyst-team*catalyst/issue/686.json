resume=\"{}/checkpoints/best.pth\".format(logdir),\r\n        verbose=True,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nAfter training the model leads into the exception.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAfter some research, I have found that the problem is that in [this line](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/37bddea809cb0aab982063940d7ba247ad3aad5c/catalyst/contrib/dl/runner/wandb.py#L60) the code expects the experiment logdir to be defined, but when calling `predict_loader` that is not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the same error described in #603 but it is closed while the problem is still present.","closed_by":{"login":"jesusmolrdv","id":8304875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDQ4NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8304875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv","html_url":"https://github.com/jesusmolrdv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusmolrdv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
