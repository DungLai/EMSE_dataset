Trying to run 30 seconds tutorial got such an error:\r\n```\r\n>>> from catalyst.dl.experiments import SupervisedRunner\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/cris/miniconda3/envs/dl/lib/python3.6/site-packages/catalyst/dl/experiments/__init__.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n    from .core import Experiment, Runner\r\n  File \"/Users/cris/miniconda3/envs/dl/lib/python3.6/site-packages/catalyst/dl/experiments/core.py\", line 10, in <module>\r\n    from catalyst.dl.state import RunnerState\r\n  File \"/Users/cris/miniconda3/envs/dl/lib/python3.6/site-packages/catalyst/dl/state.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    from catalyst.utils.misc import FrozenClass\r\nImportError: cannot import name 'FrozenClass'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter checking sources looks like `FrozenClass` was moved to `catalyst.utils.frozen`. After fixing import directly in the installed package it started producing a new error:\r\n```\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/cris/miniconda3/envs/dl/lib/python3.6/site-packages/catalyst/dl/experiments/__init__.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n    from .core import Experiment, Runner\r\n  File \"/Users/cris/miniconda3/envs/dl/lib/python3.6/site-packages/catalyst/dl/experiments/core.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    from catalyst.dl.utils import UtilsFactory\r\nImportError: cannot import name 'UtilsFactory'\r\n```\r\nI did not check further and just used `19.6.2`. It worked well.\r\n\r\nLooks like `master` already has required fixes, maybe it makes sense to release a new version or remove `19.6.3` because it's broken.","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
