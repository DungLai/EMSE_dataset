is a problem in OneCycle Scheduler parameters.\r\nAccording to https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/api/contrib.html#catalyst.contrib.scheduler.OneCycleLR it has parameters `lr_range` and `momentum_range`, that are tuples with max/min, min/max and final values.\r\nBut lr and momentum changes in the opposite way: lr decreases and momentum increases.\r\nIf I change parameters order, it works fine.\r\n\r\nWorking example:\r\n```\r\n  scheduler_params:\r\n    scheduler: OneCycleLR\r\n    num_steps: 10\r\n    lr_range: [0.000001, 0.00002]\r\n    init_lr: 0.000001\r\n    momentum_range: [0.99, 0.8]\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"belskikh","id":13022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDIyMzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh","html_url":"https://github.com/belskikh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/belskikh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
