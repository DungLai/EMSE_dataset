Maybe in this [line](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/f58ffac876f514f3b52537d62b5c81b562a93fa9/catalyst/contrib/dl/callbacks/wandb.py#L181) we should pass `metrics=splitted_epoch_metrics` instead of `metrics=splitted_epoch_metrics[extra_mode]` to `_log_metrics` method. If I do so error disappears and all works well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nI am running my script with `catalyst-dl run` and getting this error on epoch end. With [this](https://gist.github.com/PUSSYMIPT/db95014542442f2e03cd1fddf7610b88) config. Model is a multitask roberta with two heads, so I have three losses (main_loss=loss1+loss2, loss1, loss2) and one metric. \r\nSo in `state.epoch_metrics` I have something like`{\"loss\":1, \"loss_qa\":0.5, \"loss_clf\": 0.5, \"metric\": 0.7}`, in `splitted_epoch_metrics` variable i get `{\"train\": {\"loss\": 1, \"loss_qa\":0.5, \"loss_clf\": 0.5, \"metric\": 1}, \"valid\": {\"loss\": 1,\"loss_qa\":0.5, \"loss_clf\": 0.5, \"metric\": 1}}`, this is enough to reproduce key error. Anyway I don't think that error somehow depends on my code and will also reproduces with any experiment which doesn't have a loader which name starts with `base`. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nCatalyst version: 20.04.2\r\nPyTorch version: 1.5.0\r\nTensorFlow version: N/A\r\nTensorBoard version: 2.2.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\nPython version: 3.7.7\r\nCUDA runtime version: 10.1\r\n```\r\n### Additional context\r\nI can open PR\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"elephantmipt","id":37884009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODg0MDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37884009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt","html_url":"https://github.com/elephantmipt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elephantmipt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/782/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
