🐛 Bug Report\r\nIn the config API it appears that it is assumed that the train dataloader should be shuffled, as per the following line: https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/a7bc302a762d7d9f462ded6d9cd6ae70f8b656aa/catalyst/utils/data.py#L201\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is particularly undesirable when using iterable datasets, as they are incompatible with shuffle=True. It would probably be better to let the user specify the desired value of shuffle in the config.yml file. \r\nAt the moment, if the user passes:\r\n`loaders_params: {\"shuffle\": False} `\r\nit is overwritten in the mentioned line, which leads to the pytorch error:\r\n> ValueError: DataLoader with IterableDataset: expected unspecified shuffle option, but got shuffle=True\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create an iterable dataset that is created in customRunner.get_datasets()\r\n2. Use the config API to create a loader for the dataset with e.g. the following params:\r\n```\r\n loaders: &loaders     \r\n   batch_size: None  \r\n   num_workers: 0  \r\n   drop_last: False \r\n   per_gpu_scaling: False  \r\n   loaders_params: {\"shuffle\": False} \r\n```\r\n3. See the following pytorch error:\r\n\r\n> ValueError: DataLoader with IterableDataset: expected unspecified shuffle option, but got shuffle=True\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nWhen passing \r\n`loaders_params: {\"shuffle\": False} `\r\none would expect shuffling to be turned off for both loaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n```bash\r\nCatalyst version: 21.03.2\r\nPyTorch version: 1.7.1\r\nTensorFlow version: N/A\r\nTensorBoard version: 2.4.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS\r\nPython version: 3.7\r\nNvidia driver version: 460.32.03\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [ x] bug description\r\n- [ x] steps to reproduce\r\n- [ x] expected behavior\r\n- [ x] environment\r\n- [ ] code sample / screenshots\r\n  \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
