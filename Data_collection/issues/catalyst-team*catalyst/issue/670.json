The only reason for `_State` to have pre/post methods. Partly that makes `_State` behaviour to look like a Callback one, but with own set of events.\r\n2. `Runner._run_event` is too complicated: too many \"if\"-statements and `moment` argument is not needed, due to the fact that we can make `event` for every moment and there is no frequent need in extraction of the moment from the event.\r\n\r\nThis can be done in the following way:\r\n1. Metric manager can be done as callback and `_State` pre/post and metric handling methods deleted.\r\n2. With deletion of pre/post methods from the `_State` we can clean up \"if\"-statements in `Runner._run_event`. The only reason we'll need to have if statements is to figure out order of callbacks and loggers. \"Moments\" can be concatenated with \"event\" in the following way: `{event}_{moment}` to get rid of moments. [Gist example](https://gist.github.com/Arquestro/08782eae0c68c7c4bd80d38327f009c0)\r\n\r\nAlternative solution to 2 includes making a dict with events as keys and proper OrderedDict of callbacks and loggers as values for every stage. This is a bit ugly, but it will help to get rid of \"if\"-statements.
