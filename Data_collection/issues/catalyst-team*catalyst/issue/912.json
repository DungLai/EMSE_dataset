ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature proposal. -->\r\n[Hydra](https://hydra.cc) provides interesting [features](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro) to create hierarchical configuration by composition and override it through config files and the command line.\r\nI think that this ability will be useful for catalyst pipelines with configuration file.\r\nNow one configuration file contains all pipeline settings inside, but if we split it to for example model_params/data_params/runner_params/and so on then we will be able to get configuration structure distributed in sence. This will allow us to quickly run experiments with different combinations of settings and also change settings in the command line\r\n\r\nExample pipeline:\r\n```bash\r\npipeline/\r\n    conf/\r\n        config.yaml\r\n        model/\r\n            resnet.yaml\r\n            mobilenet.yaml\r\n            efficientnet.yaml\r\n        data/\r\n            imagenet.yaml\r\n            coco.yaml\r\n        runner/\r\n            runner1.yaml\r\n            runner2.yaml\r\n    src/\r\n        callbacks.py\r\n        model.py\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\nRun example:\r\n```catalyst-dl run config=conf/config.yaml model=resnet data=imagenet runner=runner1```\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n1. Create class HConfigExperiment class\r\n2. Change catalyst-dl run script\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n<!-- Please outline the motivation for the proposal. Is your feature request related to a problem? e.g., I'm always frustrated when [...]. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link here too -->\r\nCombining configuration parts for different experiments. Change settings in command line.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nI've already written simple MNIST classification pipeline with hydra configuration structure. But I can run it only with ```python train.py``` command.","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
