🐛 Bug Report\r\nActually, I'm not sure, whether it should be treated as a bug in Catalyst, but just to prevent Catalyst users from hours of complaints like:\r\n> \"Why AMPOptimizerCallback is not working?!\"\r\n\r\nBy default, if you have multiple GPUs on one machine, catalyst will automatically convert your model(s) to DataParallel. But, as was mentioned in [Automatic Mixed Precision docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/amp_examples.html#working-with-multiple-gpus) `autocast` doesn't simply work with DataParallel. And you have to change your model's `forward()` method to fix this.\r\n\r\nI don't see an easy way to fix this problem, but at least it would be helpful to warn a user about this \"feature\" (for example, mention this is the docstring of `AMPOptimizerCallback`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nJust core components:\r\n1. Run script with multiple GPUs enabled (for example via `os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"0,1\"`)\r\n2. Add `AMPOptimizerCallback` to your runner (to activate native fp16 AMP)\r\n3. Catalyst will transform your model to DataParallel\r\n4. AMP will not work:\r\n    * Outputs of your model will still be in float32\r\n    * You won't see neither consumed GPU memory reduction nor performance speedup\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n```\r\nCatalyst version: 20.10.1\r\nPyTorch version: 1.6.0\r\nPython version: 3.8.3\r\nCUDA runtime version: 10.2\r\ncuDNN version: 7.6.5\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/992/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
