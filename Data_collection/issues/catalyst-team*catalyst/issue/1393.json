ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\nSave number of total epochs trained in checkpoint files. Then, **on resume**/checkpoint load, set `runner.total_epochs` to that number from the checkpoint.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass CustomRunner(dl.Runner):\r\n    def on_epoch_start(self, runner):\r\n        print(f\"Current epoch: {self.total_epochs + 1}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nMonotonically increasing epochs for e.g. file numbers, logs, etc. Also, I want to save all checkpoints, and a unique epoch number associated with each one. This should still be monotonically increasing even if I stop then resume training. (Currently, it looks like the total epoch count isn't used and stuff gets overwritten.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [X] feature proposal description\r\n- [X] motivation\r\n- [ ] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [X] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [X] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [X] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [X] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"YodaEmbedding","id":721196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTE5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/721196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding","html_url":"https://github.com/YodaEmbedding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
