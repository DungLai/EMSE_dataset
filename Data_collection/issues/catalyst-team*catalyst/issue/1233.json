I have recently started using Catalyst and I must say It is quite awesome. Bing thanks to the contributors. So I had a question. Is there a way I can access the `runner`/ `model` inside a `catalyst.dl.Logger` instance. \r\n\r\nSo what I am specifically trying to achieve is logging my `model graph` to `wandb`. For that I need to access the `model`. I have already pathched the existing wandb logger to achieve more functionality such as `grouping`, etc.. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to access either the model or the runner inside the logger ? \r\n\r\n\r\nMy patched wandb logger >>>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass CustomWandbLogger(dl.WandbLogger):\r\n    \"\"\"A wrapper over catalyst.dl.WandbLogger\"\"\"\r\n    def __init__(self, project, name=None, entity=None, params=None):\r\n        self.project = project\r\n        self.name = name\r\n        self.entity = entity\r\n        self.run = wandb.init(project=self.project, name=self.name, entity=self.entity, allow_val_change=True, **params)\r\n        \r\n    def close_log(self): pass\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"benihime91","id":52747515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzQ3NTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52747515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91","html_url":"https://github.com/benihime91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benihime91/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
