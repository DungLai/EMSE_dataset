realize this is a very basic question, but I've gone through the docs + source code and haven't found the answer.  \r\nDoes catalyst automatically put the layers of the model in eval mode (like model.eval() would) when predicting on the validation set during training and when calling functions such as predict_loader on the validation/infer sets ?\r\n\r\nOr maybe it's not needed as such functions deal with batches and so batchnorm layers work just fine as is, without eval mode ?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","closed_by":{"login":"MathieuHaller","id":22447742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQ3NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22447742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller","html_url":"https://github.com/MathieuHaller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathieuHaller/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
