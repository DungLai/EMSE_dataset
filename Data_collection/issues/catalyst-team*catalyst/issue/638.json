This is because `batch_metrics = calculate_dice(...)` and `calculate_dice` returns a np.ndarray of the dice coefficients for each class instead of a dict.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Train a segmentation pipeline with `MulticlassDiceMetricCallback`. \r\nHaven't explored edge cases where this bug may not be an issue.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nShould work properly and return the multi-class dice scores for each class.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nI'll look towards creating a PR for this bug soon.","closed_by":{"login":"jchen42703","id":34604336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjA0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34604336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen42703","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen42703/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
