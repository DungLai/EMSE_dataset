ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nIn addition to `loader âˆˆ [train, valid, infer]`, a user should be able to define a custom loader stage.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nLooks like `self.loader_key` already allows for this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/e99f90655d0efcf22559a46e928f0f98c9807ebf/catalyst/core/runner.py#L388-L392\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe purpose of loader is to switch between datasets that will be fed into the pipeline. Therefore, the natural use cases are:\r\n1. Running inference on *multiple* datasets (e.g. `infer_coco`, `infer_kodak`, `infer_vimeo90k`, ...) and tracking their metrics in the same way as `infer`.\r\n2. Other custom stages that involve analysis using subsets of data and data loaders.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\n`self.{train/valid/infer}` variables need to be converted to functions/dictionaries. For example:\r\n```python\r\ndef handle_batch(batch):\r\n    # Previously:\r\n    if self.is_infer_coco_loader:\r\n        ...\r\n    # Proposed:\r\n    if self.loader_key == \"infer_coco\":\r\n        ...\r\n    if self.loader_key == \"infer_vimeo90k\":\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n`self.is_infer_loader` and similar can be kept, and perhaps even later deprecated.\r\n\r\nType-hints should be [naturally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_transformation) converted via the type transformation `T` -> `Mapping[str, T]`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nImplementing entire \"infer\" loop from scratch in `on_epoch_end` for each dataset/loader. Or chaining dataloaders (kind of weird, too). These wouldn't really be clean, and would not generalize to other non-standard use cases.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] feature proposal description\r\n- [x] motivation\r\n- [x] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"YodaEmbedding","id":721196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTE5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/721196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding","html_url":"https://github.com/YodaEmbedding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YodaEmbedding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1432/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
