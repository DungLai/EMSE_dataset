🐛 Bug Report\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\n#### Code sample\r\n```\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom catalyst.metrics import HitrateMetric\r\n\r\nmetric = HitrateMetric(topk_args=(1, 10, 20))\r\n\r\nlogits = torch.randn([10, 100])\r\ntargets = torch.zeros_like(logits)\r\ntargets[:, 0] = 1.0\r\n\r\nprint(metric.update_key_value(logits, targets))\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Results\r\nOccasionally, it returns ```hitrate@{x1} > hitrate@{x2}``` for ```x1 < x2```.\r\n```\r\n{'hitrate01': 0.0, 'hitrate10': 0.030000001192092896, 'hitrate20': 0.019999999552965164, 'hitrate': 0.0}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nHitrate should returns ```hitrate{x1} < hitrate{x2}``` for every ```x1 < x2```.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n```\r\nCollecting environment information...\r\nCatalyst version:
