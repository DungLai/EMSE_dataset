In the case of empty targets, mask and empty predicted mask `intersection == 0` therefore `dice == 0`. But it seems wrong because everything is predicted correctly. The small change can fix it:\r\n```\r\nintersection = torch.sum(targets * outputs)\r\nunion = torch.sum(targets) + torch.sum(outputs)\r\ndice = (2 * intersection + eps) / (union + eps)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The metric is computed as if `targets` and `outputs` were the ground truth and predicted values of the one single-channel mask. But this formula is not right if there are several channels in the mask or the batch_size > 1. Even in the case of 2 samples in batch or 2-channel mask (with possible intersections), the formula is not correct.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2 * (intersection1 + intersection2) / (union1 + union1) != intersection1/union1 + intersection2/union2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the case of several channels and large batches, the difference can be more significant. I think the metric should be computed on each channel of each sample separately and only then averaged.\r\n\r\nIf we work with batches of shape [N x H x W x CH] it can be solved like this:\r\n```\r\nintersection = (targets * outputs).mean(dim=2).mean(dim=2)\r\nunion = targets.mean(dim=2).mean(dim=2) + outputs.mean(dim=2).mean(dim=2)\r\ndice = ((2 * intersection + eps) / (union + eps)).mean()\r\n``` \r\nAs I've done here: https://github.com/IliaLarchenko/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/utils/criterion/dice.py\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure if there are other use cases with different data shapes where this approach will not work.","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
