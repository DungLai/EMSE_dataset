üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nEven we set `os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] =\"\"`, the model is still trained on the GPU. This contradicts to the [documentation](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/faq/dp.html).\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nI simply copy the linear regression minimal example [here](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well --> \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\n```python\r\n# I added these first two lines.\r\nimport os\r\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"\"\r\n\r\n\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\r\nfrom catalyst import dl\r\n\r\n\r\n# data\r\nnum_samples, num_features = int(1e4), int(1e1)\r\nX, y = torch.rand(num_samples, num_features), torch.rand(num_samples)\r\ndataset = TensorDataset(X, y)\r\nloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=1)\r\nloaders = {\"train\": loader, \"valid\": loader}\r\n\r\n# model, criterion, optimizer, scheduler\r\nmodel = torch.nn.Linear(num_features, 1)\r\ncriterion = torch.nn.MSELoss()\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())\r\nscheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR(optimizer, [3, 6])\r\n\r\n# model training\r\nrunner = dl.SupervisedRunner()\r\nrunner.train(\r\n    model=model,\r\n    criterion=criterion,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    scheduler=scheduler,\r\n    loaders=loaders,\r\n    logdir=\"./logdir\",\r\n    valid_loader=\"valid\",\r\n    valid_metric=\"loss\",\r\n    minimize_valid_metric=True,\r\n    num_epochs=4,\r\n    verbose=True\r\n)\r\n\r\n# check model on GPU or CPU\r\nprint('Is model on GPU? ', next(model.parameters()).is_cuda)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\nOuput\r\n```\r\nIs model on GPU?  True\r\n```\r\n#### More info\r\nSince the `loader` is on CPU, calling `runner.predict_batch(next(iter(loader)))` leads to the error below:\r\n```\r\nRuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu! (when checking argument for argument mat1 in method wrapper_addmm)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nPlease copy and paste the output from our environment collection script\r\n```bash\r\ncatalyst-contrib --collect-env\r\n# or manually\r\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/master/catalyst/contrib/scripts/collect_env.py\r\npython collect_env.py\r\n```\r\n(or fill out the checklist below manually).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# example checklist, fill with your info\r\nCatalyst version: 20.04.\r\nPyTorch version: 1.11.0\r\nPython version: 3.9\r\nCUDA runtime version: 11.4\r\nNvidia driver version: 472.39\r\ncuDNN version: No CUDA\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nIf we set `cpu=True` in `runner.train`, then the model indeed lies on the CPU. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ShuhuaGao","id":20141984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTQxOTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20141984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao","html_url":"https://github.com/ShuhuaGao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShuhuaGao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
