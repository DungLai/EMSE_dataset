ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nHi, I think we already discussed this in Slack, but the basic idea is the following: there is a callback called e.g `LossInterpretationCallback` which shows the best/worst examples for a loss in the Tensorboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nMotivation: quick error analysis, to gain a quick intuition on when is the model doing great and when it is doing badly. Since it is just a callback, users can always just not include it, there is no risk for other features.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nMy proposal is to create a class called `LossInterpretationCallback` located either under `contrib` or under `dl.callbacks`, that for every loader that uses a `SequentialSampler` (otherwise we cannot know the original index in the dataset) computes a given criterion reduced per sample, and then sorts it, and plot top k / bottom k examples to the Tensorboard, and also serializes the interpretations for example in a `loss_interpretation` directory, so that they can be further inspected later.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nSeveral similar, but slightly different callbacks exist:\r\n\r\n* [ShowPolarBatchesCallback](https://github.com/BloodAxe/pytorch-toolbelt/blob/c51c41f12503d76f6f3bd452aa95a7765628db07/pytorch_toolbelt/utils/catalyst/visualization.py#L34) in `pytorch-toolbelt` - shows only the best one and worst one *batches*, not samples. Slightly different, still very useful\r\n* [InterpretationCallback](https://dnncool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dnn_cool.html?highlight=InterpretationCallback#dnn_cool.catalyst_utils.InterpretationCallback) in `dnn.cool` -  the same thing, but it forces you to use multi-task learning classes, is awkward if you have just one output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nHere's for example how would the minimal classification example change:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#%%\r\n\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\r\nfrom catalyst import dl\r\n\r\n#%%\r\n# sample data\r\nnum_samples, num_features, num_classes = int(1e4), int(1e1), 4\r\nX = torch.rand(num_samples, num_features)\r\ny = (torch.rand(num_samples, ) * num_classes).to(torch.int64)\r\n\r\n# pytorch loaders\r\ndataset = TensorDataset(X, y)\r\nloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=1)\r\nloaders = {\"train\": loader, \"valid\": loader}\r\n\r\n# model, criterion, optimizer, scheduler\r\nmodel = torch.nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)\r\ncriterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())\r\nscheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR(optimizer, [2])\r\n\r\n#%%\r\ncallbacks = [dl.AccuracyCallback(num_classes=num_classes),\r\n             dl.LossInterpretationCallback(torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='none'))]\r\n#%%\r\n# model training\r\nrunner = dl.SupervisedRunner()\r\nrunner.train(\r\n    model=model,\r\n    criterion=criterion,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    scheduler=scheduler,\r\n    loaders=loaders,\r\n    logdir=\"./logdir\",\r\n    num_epochs=3,\r\n    callbacks=callbacks\r\n)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/950/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
