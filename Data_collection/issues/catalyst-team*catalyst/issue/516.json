In this situation, common solution is to use special \"ignore\" value for the not annotated label. However, one-hot encoding, that is required for many metrics callback (e.g. AUCCallback) does not support ignore labels (this is by design of one-hot encoding, for sure), so we cannot calculate metrics for such datasets.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\nThe idea is to provide two additional parameters for the metrics callbacks:\r\n- labels_filter - any callable, that will take labels list and return indices of labels to preserve\r\n- labels_encoder - any callable, that will take labels and convert them to one-hot like form.\r\nBy default, these two params should be None and `one_hot`, correspondingly.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs an alternative, I can imagine the user preparing encoded labels together with the list of indices of valida labels, to use in the callback, but it sounds like a pain.","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
