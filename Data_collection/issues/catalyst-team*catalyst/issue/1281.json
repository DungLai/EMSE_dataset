ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nI would like to add support for a [Comet ML](https://www.comet.ml/site/data-scientists/) Logger to Catalyst \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nComet provides a suite of logging and visualization options that makes it easy for practitioners to analyze, visualize and share the results of their model development process. I think it would work very well with Catalyst's focus on reproducibility, rapid experimentation, and codebase reuse. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nThe integration would follow a similar pattern to previous ones such as MLFlow, Neptune, and WandB. The workflow would look something like \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport comet_ml\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\r\nfrom catalyst import dl\r\nfrom catalyst.loggers.comet import CometLogger\r\n\r\n# data\r\nnum_samples, num_features = int(1e4), int(1e1)\r\nX, y = torch.rand(num_samples, num_features), torch.rand(num_samples)\r\ndataset = TensorDataset(X, y)\r\nloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=1)\r\nloaders = {\"train\": loader, \"valid\": loader}\r\n\r\n# model, criterion, optimizer, scheduler\r\nmodel = torch.nn.Linear(num_features, 1)\r\ncriterion = torch.nn.MSELoss()\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())\r\nscheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR(optimizer, [3, 6])\r\nlogger = CometLogger()\r\n\r\n# model training\r\nrunner = dl.SupervisedRunner()\r\nrunner.train(\r\n    model=model,\r\n    criterion=criterion,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    scheduler=scheduler,\r\n    loaders=loaders,\r\n    logdir=\"./logdir\",\r\n    valid_loader=\"valid\",\r\n    valid_metric=\"loss\",\r\n    minimize_valid_metric=True,\r\n    num_epochs=8,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n    loggers={\"comet\": logger},\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nDid not consider alternatives for this specific proposal, as this enhancement is to help Comet users log data from Catalyst. \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] feature proposal description\r\n- [x] motivation\r\n- [x] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1281/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
