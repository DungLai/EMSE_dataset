üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nWhile `runner.train()`, a **UserWarning** is raised:\r\n```\r\n<path>/python3.8/site-packages/catalyst/core/runner.py:716:\r\nUserWarning: \r\nTo copy construct from a tensor, it is recommended to use sourceTensor.clone().detach() or sourceTensor.clone().detach().requires_grad_(True), rather than torch.tensor(sourceTensor).\r\n  k: runner.engine.sync_tensor(torch.tensor(v, device=runner.device), \"mean\")\r\n```\r\nI know that is because the `runner.batch_metrics['loss']` is a tensor, and the warning will be fixed with a float loss value.\r\nHowever, a float loss value is not able to do BP. How to fix it properly?\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Train a runner\r\n2. Watch the output from python\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well --> \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\n<!-- \r\nIdeally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. \r\nMinimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. \r\nYou could use minimal examples - https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# my custom runner\r\nclass CustomRunner(dl.SupervisedRunner):\r\n    def predict_batch(self, batch, **kwargs):\r\n        return self.model(batch['mixture'])\r\n\r\n    def handle_batch(self, batch):\r\n        estimated = self.model(batch['mixture'])\r\n        self.batch = {\r\n            \"mixture\": batch['mixture'],\r\n            \"estimated\": estimated,\r\n            \"matrix\": torch.view_as_real(batch['matrix']).type(batch['mixture'].type())\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n```python\r\n# runner.batch_metrics\r\ndefaultdict(None,\r\n            {'loss': tensor(0.5958, grad_fn=<MseLossBackward>),\r\n             'lr': 0.02,\r\n             'momentum':
