The goal of metric learning is to get the model that can map some objects into vector space where similar objects will have close representation and different objects will have far representations. The typical example is the person reidentefication task - [reid](https://paperswithcode.com/task/person-re-identification). \r\n\r\nNow we only have several triplet loss implementations in\r\n[contrib](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/f58ffac876f514f3b52537d62b5c81b562a93fa9/catalyst/contrib/nn/criterion/triplet.py). But there are a lot of missing puzzle details like:\r\n* `Sampler` that can sample batches with both positive and negatives examples in sufficient quantity.\r\n* `TripletSelector` hat can provide politics for triplets selection: all triplets, hard triplets, k-hardest triplets and so on.\r\n* `RetrievalMetric` (like `cmc-score`) that can evaluate the model: usually it is calculated after splitting validation dataset into query and gallery parts.\r\nand so on\r\n\r\nIt would be great to see all of this as a consistent framework.\r\nAs datasets for debugging and example we can use: [omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) (objects are symbols) or [mars](http://www.liangzheng.com.cn/Project/project_mars.html) (objects are people) or any other suitable dataset. \r\n\r\nAlternative for reid: [deep reid](https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/deep-person-reid/) library.","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/787/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
