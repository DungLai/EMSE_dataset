üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nCatalyst uses dependency `packaging` [here](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/settings.py#L6) but does not specify it directly in any of dependency files.\r\n\r\nWhen installing catalyst via poetry `poetry add catalyst`, `packaging` dependency isn't installed. This bug is silent most of the times because some other packages as `jupyter` install `packaging`, but in my env this bug there is none of these packages.\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. `mkdir test-proj && cd test-proj` \r\n2. Create `pyproject.toml` with `catalyst` being the only dependency\r\n```toml\r\n[tool.poetry]\r\nname = \"test-proj\"\r\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\r\ndescription = \"\"\r\nauthors = [\"Your Name <you@example.com>\"]\r\n\r\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\r\npython = \"^3.7\"\r\ncatalyst = \"^22.4\"\r\n\r\n[build-system]\r\nrequires = [\"poetry-core>=1.0.0\"]\r\nbuild-backend = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\r\n```\r\n3. Create `main.py`\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir test_proj && touch test_proj/main.py && cat \"import catalyst\" > test_proj/main.py\r\n```\r\n4. Get error message\r\n```\r\n‚ùØ poetry run python test_proj/main.py \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test_proj/main.py\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    import catalyst\r\n  File \"/home/user/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/test_proj-vU8Qtjuj-py3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/catalyst/__init__.py\", line 12, in <module>\r\n    from catalyst.settings import SETTINGS\r\n  File \"/home/user/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/test_proj-vU8Qtjuj-py3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/catalyst/settings.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    from packaging.version import Version\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'packaging'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n```\r\nCatalyst version: 22.04\r\nPyTorch version: 1.11.0+cu102\r\nPython version: 3.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [ ] bug description\r\n- [ ] steps to reproduce\r\n- [ ] expected behavior\r\n- [ ] environment\r\n- [ ] code sample / screenshots\r\n  \r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [ ] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [ ] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [ ] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [ ] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [ ] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1417/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
