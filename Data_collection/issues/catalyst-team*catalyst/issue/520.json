What comes in mind:\r\n\r\n1. We can add an option on `stages` level to allow to ignore this default behavior and teach each `stage` independently. This way we would be able to teach different folds from one config, different models etc.\r\n2. We can add an option on specific `stage` level to set where to find checkpoint. It will allow us to start not from scratch but from some state even on the first `stage`.\r\n3. Also we can add some param to `infer stage` to allow it to use different checkpoints (and maybe multiple checkpoints and some strategy - how to ansamble those predictions).
