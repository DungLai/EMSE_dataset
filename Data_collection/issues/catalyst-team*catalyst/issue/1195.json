üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\n[`AdditiveValueMetric`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/3db5d21a01ab9a138bc76a26b8ca97870922f3f2/catalyst/metrics/_additive.py#L62) assumes that the metric value can be converted to float / NumPy array. But in reality, there are many cases when it is much faster and easier to calculate metrics on GPU using PyTorch. And this will cause errors as `torch.Tensor` cannot be converted to NumPy automatically.\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Use `FunctionalMetricCallback` with any metric function that returns `torch.Tensor` e.g. [`piq.psnr`](https://github.com/photosynthesis-team/piq/blob/master/piq/psnr.py#L9)\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well --> \r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\n<!-- \r\nIdeally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. \r\nMinimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. \r\nYou could use minimal examples - https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/leverxgroup/esrgan/blob/update-catalyst/esrgan/callbacks/metrics.py#L20\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\nIt would be great if `utils.detach_tensor` was used before metrics averaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nPlease copy and paste the output from our environment collection script\r\n```bash\r\ncatalyst-contrib --collect-env\r\n# or manually\r\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/master/catalyst/contrib/scripts/collect_env.py\r\npython collect_env.py\r\n```\r\n(or fill out the checklist below manually).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# example checklist, fill with your info\r\nCatalyst version: 20.04.2\r\nPyTorch version: 1.8.0\r\nTensorFlow version: N/A\r\nTensorBoard version: 2.2.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\nPython version: 3.8\r\nCUDA runtime version: No CUDA\r\nNvidia driver version: No CUDA\r\ncuDNN version: No CUDA\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] bug description\r\n- [x] steps to reproduce\r\n- [x] expected behavior\r\n- [x] environment\r\n- [x] code sample / screenshots\r\n  \r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
