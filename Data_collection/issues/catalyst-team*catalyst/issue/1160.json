üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\nApparently AccuracyCallback raises an error when 1 is not in tuple passed to AccuracyCallback as topk_args.\r\n\r\n### How To Reproduce\r\nI ran code snippet from https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/#getting-started on Google Colab while only changing topk_args in AccuracyCallback.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well --> \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nfrom torch import

attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. \r\nMinimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. \r\nYou could use minimal examples - https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAccuracyCallback should work with any tuple of positive integers.\r\n\r\n\r\n###
