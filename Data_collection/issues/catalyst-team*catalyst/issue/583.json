For every head we have an AccuracyCallback. In that case we can aggregate these values into one.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to create MetricAggregatorCallback to do that. Already working on that.\r\n\r\nI will put it into catalyst/contrib/callbacks.","closed_by":{"login":"smivv","id":17829173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODI5MTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17829173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv","html_url":"https://github.com/smivv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smivv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
