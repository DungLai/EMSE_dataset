ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature proposal. -->\r\nSklearn provides multiple cross-validation strategies, Catalyst has a very user friendly API. I would like to add a method to catalyst which will enable user to do cross validation with catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nYou could use minimal examples - https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples. \r\n-->\r\nHere are a list of possible solutions I can think of\r\n1. Create a new class essentially inheriting from IRunner which accepts torch style datasets(with keys for input(x) and targets(y)) along with a cross val object, which will enable us to create folds. A problem may occur since while training on each fold we need to create a new instance of the model or maybe reinitialize it, which may need some major modifications.\r\n2. Another approach could be we write our own cross val strategies customized for catalyst.\r\n3. Maybe we create off the shelf PyTorch Style datasets for standard tasks like classification, regression,etc. Doing this we will know the input and target keys internally and maybe adapt sklearn cross validation strategies according to it.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nThis seems like a big task and hence I want your ideas on it, on how we can go on implementing it.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] feature proposal description\r\n- [ ] motivation\r\n- [x] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n-  [x] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
