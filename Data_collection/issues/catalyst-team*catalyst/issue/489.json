The resume_path is a string \"./saved_model/best.pth\". \r\nI run into this error:\r\n    168             checkpoint_callback_flag = any([\r\n    169                 isinstance(x, CheckpointCallback)\r\n--> 170                 for x in callbacks.values()\r\n    171             ])\r\n    172             if not checkpoint_callback_flag:\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'values'\r\n\r\nThe error seems not related to the checkpoint but to the callbacks. For the callbacks argument, here is what I passed in ```callbacks=[DiceCallback(), EarlyStoppingCallback(patience=5, min_delta=-0.1)],```\r\nI think I was using the runner.train() fucntion in a incorrect way because catalyst is very good other than this.\r\nHas anyone have similar experience?","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
