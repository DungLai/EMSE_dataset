ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nThe current library is built around epochs for a lot of core functionality including the checkpoint callback and validation metric functionality. It would be very useful to allow people to use steps instead of epochs to validate and save checkpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nFor large datasets saving every epoch is pretty useless. Additionally, even for smaller datasets being able to run validation metrics more frequently can be very helpful to see how the model is performing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nFor all core functionality that currently only uses epochs add a mode parameter which can be either epoch or step. If step is selected there will be another parameter num_steps (or something similarly named) which will control how many steps between the given functionality (e.g. steps between validation runs). Though I think this should be done for all epoch tied features the two most pressing are validation runs and checkpoints.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nIt is likely possible to add this functionality with custom callbacks, but this seems like a lot of work especially given how common this request likely is.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] feature proposal description\r\n- [x] motivation\r\n- [x] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
