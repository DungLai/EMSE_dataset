I work with segmentation and it's really hard to find a good segmentation framework.\r\n\r\nI'm following the segmentation tutorial of the provided colab: [segmentation-tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/examples/notebooks/segmentation-tutorial.ipynb) and I'm creating the SegmentationDataset class to open my images. \r\n\r\nSo, I have a doubt about how to open my segmentation masks. The datasets I'm working on have .png grayscale masks, with each pixel value corresponding to a category of my problem. \r\n\r\nMy doubt is if I should convert the mask to one hot, returning an nd array of dimension [w, h, num classes, batch size] or should just to open the mask and return it. \r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
