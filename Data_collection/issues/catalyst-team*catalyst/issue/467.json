Please describe.**\r\nAfter a train epoch ends there are four rows left in the log. \r\n```\r\n0/25 * Epoch (train): 100% 156/156 [..., loss=0.815]\r\n0/25 * Epoch (valid): 100% 18/18 [..., loss=0.942]\r\n[2019-10-22 00:53:53,000] \r\n0/25 * Epoch 0 (train): _base/lr=0.0010 | ... | loss=0.9417\r\n0/25 * Epoch 0 (valid): _base/lr=0.0010 | ... | loss=1.1581\r\n```\r\nTwo last rows contain summary information about the entire epoch.
