So I checked the image and mask after the transformation, and found that value range of mask is 0~0.004, which is abnormal. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. before transformation, image is of shape 512x512x3 and value range 0-255, and  mask is binary with shape 512x512.\r\n2. use the transform.yml as it is under the _test_cv_segmentation example. \r\n3. print out the information of image and mask after transformation in dataset.py using the following snippet:\r\nprint('\\timage: %s, max %s, min%s; mask %s, max %s, min %s' %(\r\n  result['image'].shape, result['image'].max(), result['image'].min(),\r\n result['mask'].shape, result['mask'].max(), result['mask'].min()\r\n ))\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nresult['mask'].max() == 1\r\nresult['mask'].min() ==0\r\nloss goes down as training iterates.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![屏幕快照 2020-04-01 下午11 06 59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24452296/78158229-90587a00-7473-11ea-970a-e4c2422d7ce6.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"baibaidj","id":24452296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDUyMjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24452296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj","html_url":"https://github.com/baibaidj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baibaidj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
