I coudn't find anything about it.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make some changes on the TensorboardLogger in my project. \r\nSo I wrote a callback MyTensorboardLogger, registered it ..etc. works.\r\nHowever the standart one is still working in parallel.  I couldn't find how to deactivate it.  Is it possible?\r\nOr is there a way to overwrite a callback with my own version, so the orginal  version won't be called?\r\n( Would be really nice for the logging callbacks)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"uyekt","id":22679060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjc5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22679060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt","html_url":"https://github.com/uyekt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uyekt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
