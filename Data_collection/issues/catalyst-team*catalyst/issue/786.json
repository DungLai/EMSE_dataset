ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nWe need to rethink current metrics implementations [one](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/tree/master/catalyst/utils/meters), [two](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/tree/master/catalyst/utils/metrics) to create a standardised metrics interface during model training and validation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nWe already have\r\n- [metric-based callbacks system](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/core/callback.py#L21)\r\n- [metric implementations with Meters](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/tree/master/catalyst/utils/meters)\r\n- [functional metric implementations](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/tree/master/catalyst/utils/metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's time to standardise them a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nSuppose, we need to create several abstractions, like `BatchMetric`, `EpochMetric` + something custom for `ConfusionMatrix` case?\r\n\r\nWe could use a `Meter` interface:\r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass Meter(object):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This class is abstract, but provides a standard interface for all meters to\r\n    follow.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def reset(self):\r\n        \"\"\"Resets the meter to default settings.\"\"\"\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def add(self, value):\r\n        \"\"\"Log a new value to the meter.\r\n        Args:\r\n            value: Next result to include.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def value(self):\r\n        \"\"\"Get the value of the meter in the current state.\"\"\"\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith update for\r\n- distributed computing\r\n- metrics arithmetics, for example to handle `metric4 = (metric1 + metric2) / (metric3 * 2.0)`-like cases\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nOn the other hand, we could provide only some predefined number of metric implementations (as we already have).\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
