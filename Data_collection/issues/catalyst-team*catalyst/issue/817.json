üêõ Bug Report\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nHi ^^\r\nFirst I appology cause I'm quite noob in R and informatics...\r\n\r\nI obtain this error message when trying to compensate FCS files from a Mass Cytometry experiment :\r\nWarning: Error in .check_sm:\r\nThe supplied spillover matrix seems to be invalid.\r\nAll isotopes should appear in `isotope_list`.\r\n  108: stop\r\n  107: .check_sm\r\n  106: .local\r\n  105: plotSpillmat\r\n  103: .local\r\n  102: CATALYST:lotSpillmat\r\n  100: renderPlotly [server-compensation.R#302]\r\n   99: func\r\n   96:

(!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\r\n  install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\r\nBiocManager::install(\"CATALYST\")\r\nlibrary(CATALYST)\r\nlibrary(cowplot)\r\nlibrary(flowCore)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(SingleCellExperiment)\r\ninstall.packages(\"V8\")\r\nCATALYST::launchGUI()\r\n\r\nThere, uploading and channels selection and deconvolution operate properly, but spillover estimate fails.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well --> \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code sample\r\n<!-- Ideally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. \r\nMinimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug.

you expected to happen. -->\r\nEdit spillover matrix from my experiment\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nPlease copy and paste the output from our environment collection script\r\n```bash\r\ncatalyst-contrib
