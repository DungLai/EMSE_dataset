Is your feature request related to a problem? e.g., I'm always frustrated when [...]. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link here too -->\r\n\r\nSklearn metrics play an essential role in ml models benchmarking.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nYou could use minimal examples - https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nPossible usage\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\r\nfrom catalyst import dl\r\n\r\n# sample data\r\nnum_samples, num_features, num_classes = int(1e4), int(1e1), 4\r\nX = torch.rand(num_samples, num_features)\r\ny = (torch.rand(num_samples, num_classes) > 0.5).to(torch.float32)\r\n\r\n# pytorch loaders\r\ndataset = TensorDataset(X, y)\r\nloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=1)\r\nloaders = {\"train\": loader, \"valid\": loader}\r\n\r\n# model, criterion, optimizer, scheduler\r\nmodel = torch.nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)\r\ncriterion = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())\r\nscheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR(optimizer, [2])\r\n\r\n# model training\r\nrunner = dl.SupervisedRunner(\r\n    input_key=\"features\", output_key=\"logits\", target_key=\"targets\", loss_key=\"loss\"\r\n)\r\nrunner.train(\r\n    model=model,\r\n    criterion=criterion,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    scheduler=scheduler,\r\n    loaders=loaders,\r\n    logdir=\"./logdir\",\r\n    num_epochs=3,\r\n    valid_loader=\"valid\",\r\n    valid_metric=\"accuracy\",\r\n    minimize_valid_metric=False,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n    callbacks=[\r\n        dl.BatchTransformCallback(\r\n            transform=torch.sigmoid,\r\n            scope=\"on_batch_end\",\r\n            input_key=\"logits\",\r\n            output_key=\"scores\"\r\n        ),\r\n        dl.AUCCallback(input_key=\"logits\", target_key=\"targets\"),\r\n        dl.MultilabelAccuracyCallback(input_key=\"logits\", target_key=\"targets\", threshold=0.5),\r\n        # here is the trick\r\n        dl.SklearnCallback(\r\n            keys={\"y_score\": \"scores\", \"y_true\": \"targets\"}, \r\n            metirc_fn=sklearn.metrics.coverage_error, \r\n            metric_key=\"coverage_error\",\r\n        )\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also should add sklearn as an extra module to the Catalyst [like `ml` one](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/settings.py#L154).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\nWe could implement everything with PyTorch, which we should do next. Nevertheless, sklearn full support is still required as a great integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] feature proposal description\r\n- [x] motivation\r\n- [x] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
