❓ Questions and Help\r\n\r\n#### What is your question?\r\nWhat is the correct way of making a QueryGallery Dataset from Pytorch ImageFolder Dataset? \r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is because the MNIST example isn't necessarily the same. \r\n\r\nI am confused by the mnist test dataset being preshuffled and having the gallery images randomly assigned to the last 20%.
