ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\nSimply add a new function in the `TensorboardLogger(ILogger)` code that allows to add histograms to Tensorboard. This allows better logging in Tensorboard.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nI often use the histogram in my deep learning projects and having this feature within the Tensorboard class will allow me to improve my logging in catalyst-dl. \r\n\r\nIt is not particuarly hard to implement and I have provided the code below.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n```\r\n    def log_weights(\r\n        self,\r\n        runner: \"IRunner\",\r\n    ) -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"Logs model weights to Tensorboard for current epoch.\"\"\"\r\n        assert runner.loader_key is not None\r\n        # check saving weights is possible\r\n        if 'named_parameters' in dir(runner.model):\r\n            self._check_loader_key(loader_key=runner.loader_key)\r\n            # log weights of model\r\n            for name, params in runner.model.named_parameters():\r\n                # save weights as histogram\r\n                self.loggers[runner.loader_key].add_histogram(\r\n                    tag=name, values=params, global_step=runner.epoch_step,\\\r\n                    bins='tensorflow'\r\n                )\r\n```\r\n\r\nI call the above function in a custom callback:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass TbSave(dl.Callback):\r\n    def __init__(self, input_key='features', log_weights=True):\r\n        super().__init__(order=dl.CallbackOrder.External)\r\n        # key of input to be saved\r\n        self.input_key=input_key\r\n        self.log_weights = log_weights\r\n        self.train_batch = 1\r\n        self.test_batch = 1\r\n\r\n    def save_inputs(self, runner):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Save all the inputs as images,\r\n        uses tensorboard. \r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        # train flag\r\n        train = runner.is_train_loader\r\n        # save from train flag\r\n        if train:\r\n            tag = 'train/' + str(self.train_batch)\r\n        else:\r\n            tag = 'test/' + str(self.test_batch)\r\n        # get images from key\r\n        images = runner.batch[self.input_key]\r\n        # make grid of batch, # permute (CHW) -> (HWC)\r\n        grid = torchvision.utils.make_grid(images).permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()\r\n        # log the image\r\n        runner.loggers['tb2'].log_image(runner=runner, image=grid, tag=tag)\r\n\r\n    def on_epoch_end(self, runner):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        On epoch end.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        assert 'tb2' in runner.loggers.keys()\r\n        # reset batch\r\n        self.train_batch = 1\r\n        self.test_batch = 1\r\n        # save weights of model\r\n        runner.loggers['tb2'].log_weights(runner=runner)\r\n\r\n    def on_batch_end(self, runner):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        On batch end.\r\n        Input: runner\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        assert 'tb2' in runner.loggers.keys()\r\n        # record inputs and outputs on first epoch\r\n        if (runner.epoch_step == 1) and ('tb2' in runner.loggers.keys()):\r\n            self.save_inputs(runner)\r\n        # + batch for tags to save\r\n        if runner.is_train_loader:\r\n            self.train_batch += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            self.test_batch += 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this implementation would be greatly simplified by having the function within the logger class. That way I do not need to ensure `assert 'tb2' in runner.loggers.keys()`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nI considered using a new custom logger but this did not integrate with other loggers and Tensorboard's file compression massively saves space.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nHere is what the output looks like:\r\n<img width=\"1432\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-03-04 at 10 58 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51797647/156751244-9f6a8a49-dc7d-4b79-90d7-f612ad33f829.png\">\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x ] feature proposal description\r\n- [ x] motivation\r\n- [ x] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review\r\n  \r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nPlease review the FAQ before submitting an issue:\r\n- [x ] I have read the [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)\r\n- [x ] I have reviewed the [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)\r\n- [x ] I have checked the [changelog](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for main framework updates\r\n- [x ] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x ] I have joined [Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1408/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
