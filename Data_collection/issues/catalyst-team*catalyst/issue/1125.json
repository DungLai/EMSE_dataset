ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature proposal. -->\r\nI would like to add [Additive Margin Softmax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05599v4.pdf) to its amazing list of various 'Face' losses.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n<!-- Please outline the motivation for the proposal. Is your feature request related to a problem? e.g., I'm always frustrated when [...]. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link here too -->\r\n\r\nCatalyst has nice support for metric learning and I would like catalyst modules to be expanded more and possibly have most SOTA implementations of Face metrics.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nYou could use minimal examples - https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples. \r\n-->\r\nJust like how ArcFace and CosFace are implemented in the catalyst library, I would like to add AM-Softmax to this list as well. Possibly other metric learning modules if provided the opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nAdditive margin softmax was used in 2nd place solution of a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/discussion/83885) competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] feature proposal description.\r\n- [x] motivation.\r\n- [ ] extra proposal context / proposal alternatives review.\r\n- [x] I know, that I could [join Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion.\r\n\r\n### Note \r\n \r\nThis goes without saying I want to implement it","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1125/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
