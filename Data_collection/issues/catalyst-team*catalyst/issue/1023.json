ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\nI suggest adding the ability to leave the batch size the same as in the config for `DDP` training. Now it is impossible.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nFor now, if you add `--distributed` flag for training the batch size from config will leave the same. But - because `DDP` has N processes, each process will get the batch size from config and as a result, we will actually get batch_size = `N * batch_size`. It is very inconvenient because you need to have a different config if you want to train on different numbers of GPUs.\r\nThere is no such problem for `DataParallel` training because there is a parameter `per_gpu_scaling`. If we set this parameter as `False` we will leave total batch_size the same as in config. If `True` - we will have total batch_size = `N * batch_size`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nWhat I propose is to add consistent behavior of batch_size scaling for `DDP` training. We can leave the parameter `per_gpu_scaling` and just add some logic for `DDP`. To be consistent with `DP`:\r\n1. if `per_gpu_scaling: True` we just leave the batch_size as in config. As a result, batch_size will scale for each process and we will get batch_size = `N * batch_size`\r\n2. if `per_gpu_scaling: False` we should set `batch_size = batch_size / N`  so total batch_size will be the same. But if batch_size is not divisible by N we raise `ValueError` with asking to set batch_size which will be divisible by the number of GPUs. I saw the exact behavior here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/retinanet-examples and it is very convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nAny alternative variants are appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS\r\n- [x] I know, that I could [join Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue discussion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"litvinich","id":37345721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzQ1NzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37345721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich","html_url":"https://github.com/litvinich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litvinich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1023/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1023/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
