The mixup callback raises a [`None error`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/callbacks/mixup.py#L19) \r\nThe reason is, `state.input` has been not updated. \r\nThe [`on_batch_start`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/experiments/core.py#L187) is called before a batch is assigned to [`state.input`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/experiments/core.py#L168) \r\nI took a look around your code, IMO, the `mixup` should be called before `batch prediction`. My current solution (locally) can work but maybe it is not suitable for your design. So, I leave this for your team.\r\n\r\n2. Mixup is only applied to training \r\nThe current code applies mixup for all steps (training, validation, inference) - if it works. \r\n\r\n3. Which is mixup correct? \r\nI refer to some implementations of mixup:\r\n- mixup implemented by [`facebookresearch`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mixup-cifar10/blob/master/train.py#L119) \r\n- mixup implemented by [`fastai`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/callbacks/mixup.py#L6) \r\n- Your mixup \r\nThey are slightly different  :smile: \r\n\r\n4. Mixup loss \r\nI think mixup loss is necessary.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
