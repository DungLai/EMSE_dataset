But I am sure that when I use my own code written by myself (without catalyst), there is no leaking issue. I tried to pre-procedure this issue from your [examples](https://github.com/Scitator/catalyst-examples), but it runs very fast and we could not see the leak.\r\n\r\nFollowing is my leak descriptions:\r\n\r\n- Image classification task with ~17M images\r\n- The memory leak occurs every epoch and it happens at the next epoch again.\r\nEX:  \r\nAt the beginning of epoch 0, my memory is:\r\n\r\n  - RAM: 13G/16G\r\n  - Swap: 0/50G \r\n\r\n  At the end of epoch 0, my memory is:\r\n  - RAM: 16G/16G\r\n  - Swap: 25G/50G\r\n\r\n  When epoch 0 ends, the memories (RAM + Swap) are released, (RAM: 13G/16G, SwapL: 0/50G). The same phenomena occurs at the next epoch 1.\r\n\r\nI am debugging to see where the issue comes from. Could you please double check with your bigger data? \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ngxbac","id":11550123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTUwMTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11550123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac","html_url":"https://github.com/ngxbac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
