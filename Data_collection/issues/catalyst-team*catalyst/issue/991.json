🚀 Feature Request\r\nAs described in [PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/amp_recipe.html#saving-resuming) you must save not only `model`, `optimizer`, `criterion`, and `scheduler` but also `scaler` if you are doing fp16 training with automatic mixed precision.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nProperly restore training state.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nProbably we need to move `GradScaler` instance from `AMPOptimizerCallback` to runner  and update code of `CheckpointCallback`\r\n\r\nPS\r\n- [x] I know, that I could [join Catalyst slack (#__questions channel)](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) for issue
