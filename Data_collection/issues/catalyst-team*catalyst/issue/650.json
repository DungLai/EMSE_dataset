Please describe.**\r\nI found two Issues (#624 and #630) that is trying to address problems that occur when it's\r\nnecessary to create new configuration each time when you want to create new experiment.\r\nTo be more precise lets consider the case when you want to run experiment with different models to check their performance. You need to create two config files. But if you want to run those experiments with on two datasets you need 4 separate config files. More options you want to have, more numbers of configs you need to create and this number growth exponentially and become hardly to manage.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRecently FAIR released library called hydra (www.hydra.cc) that address case described above. \r\nLibrary support modular approach that is used in convinient programming and use more convinient way to organize input argument parsing.\r\nFor more, read: https://hydra.cc/docs/intro\r\n(they describe use cases very clearly)","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
