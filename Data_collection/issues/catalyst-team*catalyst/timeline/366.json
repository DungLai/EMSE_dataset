Here is my solution.\r\n\r\n1. In the configure file (ex: config.yml), you should to add `resume` to the config:\r\n```yml\r\nargs:\r\n  expdir: \"src\"\r\n  logdir: &logdir \"logs\"\r\n  baselogdir: \"logs\"\r\n  resume: #your checkpoint\r\n``` \r\n2. Modify your `runner.py` \r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass ModelRunner(Runner):\r\n    def predict_batch(self, batch: Mapping[str, Any]):\r\n        output = self.model(batch[\"images\"])\r\n        return {\r\n            \"logits\": output\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    def _run_stage(self, stage: str):\r\n        self._prepare_state(stage)\r\n        loaders = self.experiment.get_loaders(stage)\r\n        self.callbacks = self.experiment.get_callbacks(stage)\r\n\r\n        self._run_event(\"stage_start\")\r\n        for epoch in range(18, self.state.num_epochs):\r\n            self.state.stage_epoch = epoch\r\n\r\n            self._run_event(\"epoch_start\")\r\n            self._run_epoch(loaders)\r\n            self._run_event(\"epoch_end\")\r\n\r\n            if self._check_run and self.state.epoch >= 3:\r\n                break\r\n            if self.state.early_stop:\r\n                self.state.early_stop = False\r\n                break\r\n\r\n            self.state.epoch += 1\r\n        self._run_event(\"stage_end\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn here, I resume from `epoch 18`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/533873649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngxbac","id":11550123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTUwMTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11550123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac","html_url":"https://github.com/ngxbac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngxbac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2652612026,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY1MjYxMjAyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/events/2652612026","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-22T11:30:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2652612027,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NTI2MTIwMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/events/2652612027","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-22T11:30:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/534690316","html_url":"https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/366#issuecomment-534690316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/366","id":534690316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDY5MDMxNg==","user":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T18:33:09Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T18:33:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nSorry
