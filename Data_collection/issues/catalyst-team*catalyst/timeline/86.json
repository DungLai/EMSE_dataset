After checking Smith's reports I'm not sure about necessity default value.

And, probably, it would be better if user would ask himself about final_lr.\r\n\r\n2. However, implementing 'terminating on nan' as a standalone callback, outside LRFinder, seems to be better option since it reusability. Such callback would be like a 'early stopping', which, in general, may occurs when overfitting detected, etc. I think, it must be taken into consideration for better code structure.\r\n\r\n3.

May be, it is worth to add static method for parsing directly in `Logger` callback?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/457949747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ivbelkin","id":23017087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDE3MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23017087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin","html_url":"https://github.com/ivbelkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivbelkin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/457953201","html_url":"https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/86#issuecomment-457953201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/86","id":457953201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Nzk1MzIwMQ==","user":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-27T20:52:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T20:52:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So, I think you can modify LoggerCallback to write all metrics in some `logs.json` also.
