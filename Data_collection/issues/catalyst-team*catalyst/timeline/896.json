So i guess that is the reason why it is not implemented.\r\n\r\nHowever, before closing this issue, i had another problem using Dice and IoU callbacks this time. These callbacks needs the class mapping to compare them with the targets, but my network outputs the probabilities for each class. So i overwrote the callbacks like that but it seems to me that is not the best way to do it. Does anyone has a better solution ?\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass NewDiceCallback(DiceCallback):\r\n    def __init__( [...] ):\r\n        [...]\r\n\r\n    def _compute_metric_value(self, runner: IRunner):\r\n
