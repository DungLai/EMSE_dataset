Indeed what you suggest works. It is very strange why I don't have this problem with 20.12 but I can make the above test case work by simply setting the environment before importing torch as such:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"1\"\r\nimport math\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom catalyst import dl\r\n```\r\nSo, apologies, problem appears to be from my side. Thanks again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/805068585/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GR4HAM","id":10651927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjUxOTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10651927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM","html_url":"https://github.com/GR4HAM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GR4HAM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/805071261","html_url":"https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1133#issuecomment-805071261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1133","id":805071261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNTA3MTI2MQ==","user":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T17:03:22Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T17:03:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"A lot of underhood CUDA stuff could be changed after dl frameworks imports ;)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/805071261/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4497453952,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQ5NzQ1Mzk1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/events/4497453952","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-23T17:03:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
