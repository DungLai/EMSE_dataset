Thanks for investigation. üëç \r\n\r\nIf I understand the bug correctly, the solution is quite simple:\r\n```python\r\ncheckpoint_metric = checkpoint[\"valid_metrics\"].get(main_metric)\r\ncheckpoint_metric = \\\r\n\tcheckpoint_metric \r\n\tif checkpoint_metric is not None\r\n\telse checkpoint.get(\"epoch\")\r\nif checkpoint_metric is None:\r\n\tcheckpoint_metric = float(\"+inf\") \\\r\n\t\tif minimize_metric \\\r\n\t\telse float(\"-inf\")\r\n```\r\nNevertheless, I was never thought, that so much code needed for such simple case.\r\n\r\nSo, to test the hypothesis, could you please:\r\n1. clone the catalyst repo\r\n2. apply code above for CheckpointerCallback there\r\n3. switch to repo catalyst version in your python env:\r\n```\r\npip uninstall catalyst\r\npip install -e -U .  # from the root of the repo\r\n```\r\n4. Run your example one more time to determine if we have fixed the bug.\r\n5. (additional) Make a PR if you would like, or we can make it ourselves
