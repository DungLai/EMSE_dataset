For example, in \"Setup 4 - training with additional metrics\" you can run\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# model training\r\nrunner.train(\r\n    model=model,\r\n    criterion=criterion,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    scheduler=scheduler,\r\n    loaders=loaders,\r\n    callbacks=[\r\n        PrecisionCallback(),\r\n        EarlyStoppingCallback(patience=2, min_delta=0.01)\r\n    ],\r\n    logdir=logdir,\r\n    n_epochs=n_epochs,\r\n    main_metric=\"precision01\", # \"precision03\" or \"precision05\"\r\n    minimize_metric=False,\r\n    verbose=True\r\n)\r\n```\r\nand checkpointer will save model based on \"precision01\" (aka accuracy) metric. \r\nBy default, `SupervisedRunner` (and `SupervisedExperiment`) have checkpointer turned on during train stage.\r\n\r\nIf you are using config-interface, like [here](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/tree/master/examples/cifar_stages), all you need to do - specify `state_params` [here](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/examples/cifar_stages/config.yml#L18): `main_metric` and `minimize_metric` again.\r\n\r\nAll the experiment checkpoints are located at `{your_logdir}/checkpoints/*`. By default, catalyst additionally saves best checkpoint (based on chosen metric) - `best.pth` and last one - `last.pth`.\r\n\r\nFYI, source code for `train` method is [here](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/experiments/runner.py#L237) and checkpointer logic through  `CheckpointCallback` is [here](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/callbacks/base.py#L12).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/472320929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/472471702","html_url":"https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/120#issuecomment-472471702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/120","id":472471702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjQ3MTcwMg==","user":{"login":"gazay","id":29658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay","html_url":"https://github.com/gazay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gazay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T15:27:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T15:27:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome,
