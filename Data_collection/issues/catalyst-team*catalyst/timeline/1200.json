I actually was looking towards Catalyst-RL because of this multi-headed DQN as per this [PR](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/pull/198) that I wanted to use in a multi-agent environment. \r\n\r\nI looked at this [catalyst atari example](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-rl/tree/master/examples/atari). I see that the multi-headed dqn is part of this [dqn.py](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-rl/blob/master/catalyst_rl/rl/offpolicy/algorithms/dqn.py), and the config file is [this](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-rl/blob/master/examples/atari/config_dqn.yml). In order to use multi-headed DQN, I only need to uncomment [line46](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-rl/blob/ec18ff4a58b6d00652f772231db8de86debb4b3d/examples/atari/config_dqn.yml#L46) right?\r\n\r\n1. Can I use this DQN only on the Gym Atari, and not any other custom environments? \r\n2. If I can use it on other custom environments (similar to Atari, I am actually looking at a multi-agent Atari from [PettingZoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/atari)), can you show me how by an example code or reference to some other implemented work using catalyst-rl?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/834414735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rfali","id":45505149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTA1MTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45505149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali","html_url":"https://github.com/rfali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4702089668,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDcwMjA4OTY2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/events/4702089668","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-07T13:51:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4702089685,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3MDIwODk2ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/events/4702089685","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-07T13:51:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/836350984","html_url":"https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1200#issuecomment-836350984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1200","id":836350984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNjM1MDk4NA==","user":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-10T08:19:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-10T08:19:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry,
