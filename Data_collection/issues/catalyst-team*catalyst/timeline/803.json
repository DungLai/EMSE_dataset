you please describe what do you mean by a bug?\r\n\r\nThere are two layers of `_key_value` in the `get_transforms` function. And in each case logic is a little bit different:\r\n1. If `transform_params` isn't defined in the config, then the output will be an identity function. See https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/experiment/config.py#L412 for details.\r\n2. The first key is `False` e.g.\r\n    ```\r\n    transform_params:\r\n      transform: albumentation.Compose\r\n      transforms: [list of amazing image-mask transforms]\r\n    ``` \r\n    The same transform will be used for all data loaders. `albumentation` transforms expects that the input will be passed as key-value (`transform(image=image, mask=mask)`) and by default dataset return dicts. That's why we wrap transform with the helper function that will unpack dict for us. See https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/experiment/config.py#L418 for details.\r\n3. The first key is `True`, the second is `False` -> similar to 2. but for each loader, the custom transform can be applied. See https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/experiment/config.py#L407 for details.\r\n4. The first key is `True`, the second is `True`, e.g.:\r\n    ```\r\n    transform_params:\r\n      _key_value: True\r\n      train:\r\n        _key_value: True\r\n        image:\r\n          transform: albumentation.Compose\r\n          transforms: [list of amazing image transforms]\r\n        mask:\r\n          transform: albumentation.Compose\r\n          transforms: [list of amazing mask transforms]\r\n    ``` \r\n    Transform of each key of each sample is independent. To handle this logic so we added `AugmentorCompose` abstraction. Input for `AugmentorCompose` is dict, so there is no need to wrap transform with helper function as in 2. and 3.

I may need more time to make sense of it. \r\n\r\nIn my testing, the transform.yml configuration falls into the 3rd category `True` for the first key and `False` for the second. The specifics is like this :\r\n```\r\ntransform_params:\r\n    _key_value: True\r\n    train:\r\n      transform: A.Compose\r\n      transforms:\r\n        - transform: A.SmallestMaxSize\r\n          max_size: *resize_size\r\n          p: 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI implemented my dataset like this:\r\n```\r\n    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> dict:\r\n        \"\"\"Main method\"\"\"\r\n        img_path = self.images[idx]\r\n        image = open_image_multi_channel(img_path, channel= 3)\r\n        mask = open_mask_random(self.masks[idx])\r\n        result = {'image': image}\r\n        # extract certain classes from mask (e.g. cars)\r\n        if self.label_mapping is not None:\r\n            mask = convert_label(mask, self.label_mapping)\r\n        result['mask'] = mask\r\n        if self.transforms:\r\n            result = self.transforms(**result) # ablu.transform 可以对2d mask 进行操作\r\n            # add 1 channel to binary mask to be compatible with prediction\r\n            result['mask'] = result['mask'].float().unsqueeze(0)\r\n        result['filename'] = str(img_path)\r\n        # print_range(result['image'].numpy(), result['mask'].numpy())\r\n        return result\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen running the training, I encountered the issue shown in the screenshots. \r\nIn the first screenshot, I tried to print the type of the `transforms` before and after the judgement chunk. As your can see, after the judgement, the `transforms`  is no longer the supposedly albu.Compose object but some kind of `function` instead.  As a result, it could not accept `input: dict` as kwargs and throw out error as shown by the second screenshot. \r\n\r\nBut after I removed the `not` in the `elif not isinstance(transform, AugmentorCompose):`, the issue went away and the training is running smoothly. \r\n\r\nBased on these observation, I assumed that the `not` may not be in the right place. \r\n\r\nHope I explained clearly.
