the easy version to play with.  The more annoying bit of what I envision is passing the profiler rather than a flag in order to have it be fully configurable.  This means that we validate the profiler after its passed, but that's not too bad either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/824785909/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ssktotoro","id":6617297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTcyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6617297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro","html_url":"https://github.com/ssktotoro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssktotoro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/824899938","html_url":"https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1187#issuecomment-824899938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/1187","id":824899938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDg5OTkzOA==","user":{"login":"eloygeenjaar","id":55933473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTMzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55933473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar","html_url":"https://github.com/eloygeenjaar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eloygeenjaar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-22T14:38:13Z","updated_at":"2021-04-22T14:38:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is definitely a trade-off here, a lot of the arguments to the profiler we can extract from the environment, e.g.: whether to profile both the CPU and CUDA or only CPU.

The question is then: do we want to make it as easy as possible on the user by introducing a flag?
