great!\r\nFrom my experience, I usually see Travis CI as a test&deploy service. So, let's try it here too.\r\n\r\nBy the way, several suggestions, that I think can help with this stuff:\r\n1. As prometheus isn't a lib and works as submodule, the best way to test it - use its' [examples](https://github.com/Scitator/prometheus-examples) as main \"lib\" project. At least I think so. \r\n2. From my point of view, [ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) lib is one with good CI, tests and docs organisation. Again, I am not an expert in this things, but look quite promising. \r\n\r\nAnd thanks for
