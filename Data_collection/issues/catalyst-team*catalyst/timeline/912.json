@Scitator.\r\nIn addition the good list @otherman16 put up, here are a few extra things:\r\n* Launcher plugins can launch any Hydra app to different places without changing the code. There are already plugins for SLURM, Joblib (local parallel execution), Redis Queue and more. There is a Ray based Launcher plugin coming that will support launching to AWS.\r\n* Advanced Sweeper plugins like Ax and Nevergrad lets you perform hyper parameter optimization on any Hydra app without changing its code.\r\n* Automatic working directory management\r\n* Automatic logging configuration\r\n\r\nML Frameworks often solves many similar problems, Hydra aims to reduce the effort duplication, and to create a standardized and powerful interface. That interface is more powerful than what most framework will bother to create and it is completely generic. This means users that learn how to use Hydra will feel right at home with any other Hydra powered application.\r\nI can tell you that a few high profile ML frameworks are already switching to Hydra. ([fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) has an internal prototype with Hydra at advanced stages), and [mmf](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf) is using OmegaConf and will switch to Hydra once Hydra catches up on a few features it have implemented and are missing.\r\nThere are also some Non-Facebook frameworks that are switching or switched like [NVIDIA's NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo), [deepspeech.pytorch](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch) and more.\r\n\r\nI am happy to answer any questions you may have in the [Hydra
