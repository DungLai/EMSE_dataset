For example, you can see `Experiment` creation under [`.train`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/runner/core.py#L134#L157)(quite strain-forward code, I suppose). Then we have just a bunch of for-loops encapsulation during [`run_experiment`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/runner/core.py#L134#L157), like \r\n![loop](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-pics/raw/master/pics/train_loop.png)\r\n(btw, Catalyst is the only framework with stages support)\r\n\r\nSo, generally speaking you can easily create an instance of your own [`_Experiment`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/core/experiment.py#L13) and use\r\n```\r\nexperiment = MyCustomExperiment(_Experiment)\r\nrunner.run_experiment(experiment)\r\n```\r\neasy, isn't it? We think so too. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSuch design gave us an opportunity to create [`ConfigExperiment`](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/dl/experiment/config.py) for example, where you can incapsulate your whole experiment into config files. A bit [tricky example](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/tests/_tests_cv_classification_transforms/config2.yml), but it shows, how you can parametrise... **everything**. The run command is still very simple:\r\n```\r\ncatalyst-dl run -C=/path/to/config\r\n```\r\nor, we could also use, something like\r\n```\r\ncatalyst-dl run -C=/path/to/config1 /path/to/config2 /path/to/config3\r\n```\r\nto reparametrise `config1` with `config2` and `config1+config2` with `config3`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, we could even reparametrise some parts of the config through command line interface:\r\n```\r\ncatalyst-dl run -C=/path/to/config \\\r\n  --stages/criterion_params/criterion=\"BCEWithLogitsLoss\":str\r\n```\r\nIn this case you will use `BCEWithLogitsLoss` during training instead of config-defined `CrossEntropyLoss` for [this example](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/tests/_tests_cv_classification_transforms/config2.yml).\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you can do something like\r\n```\r\ncatalyst-dl run -C=/path/to/config1 /path/to/config2 /path/to/config3 \\\r\n  --stages/criterion_params/criterion=\"BCEWithLogitsLoss\":str\r\n```\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, your final training config will be saved under `/logdir/_config.json` to ensure reproducibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/comments/627800424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3339519605,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzMzOTUxOTYwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/events/3339519605","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-15T06:20:16Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3339519607,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzMzOTUxOTYwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/events/3339519607","actor":{"login":"Scitator","id":7606451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDY0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator","html_url":"https://github.com/Scitator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scitator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-15T06:20:16Z","label":{"name":"help
