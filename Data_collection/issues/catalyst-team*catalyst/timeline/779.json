and CRC32C are slightly different algorithms so that we can't simply replace `crc32c` with `binascii`. Although the computation is the same, CRC32C uses a different polynomial, and the results are different. I used `crc32c` instead of pure-Python implementation because crc32c is a highly optimized library that can use the CRC32C instruction from the SSE 4.2 set (if it is available). It's normal for tensorboard logs to be huge, so speed matters. \r\nThat is strange that you couldn't install it on Windows. As far as I can see, the wheels in the [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/crc32c/#files) contain precompiled binaries, and there is no need to have Visual Studio installed at all. I would advise you to create an issue for [`crc32c`](https://github.com/ICRAR/crc32c) if the problem persists.\r\nAs a workaround, we can remove crc32c from dependencies at all. We can use  `crc32c` if it's installed and pure-Python (and slow) implementation if not.\r\n@Scitator what do you
