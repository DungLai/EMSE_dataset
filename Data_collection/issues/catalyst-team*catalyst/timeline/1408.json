As for me, if it's just for custom callback purposes - it's fine to keep it just as an extension of the current TensorboardLogger :) Nevertheless, if you could propose a general way to log model weights at the end of each epoch (or some general setup), we could easily integrate it into the codebase. Especially if it's a general setup for other loggers.\r\n> \r\n> FYI @AyushExel @jakubczakon\r\n\r\nYep, here is my proposal (I only did tensorboard):\r\n\r\n\r\nIn catalyst/catalyst/core/runner.py:\r\n\r\n  In class IRunner(ICallback, ILogger, ABC):\r\n```\r\n      def log_weights(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:\r\n          \"\"\"Logs model weights if available to available loggers.\"\"\"\r\n            for logger in self.loggers.values():\r\n                if 'log_weights' in dir(logger):\r\n                    logger.log_weights(*args, **kwargs, runner=self)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn IRunner.on_epoch_end(self, runner: \"IRunner\")\r\n```\r\n    def on_epoch_end(self, runner: \"IRunner\"):\r\n        \"\"\"Event handler.\"\"\"\r\n        self.log_metrics(metrics=self.epoch_metrics, scope=\"epoch\")\r\n        self.log_weights()\r\n        self.experiment_metrics[self.epoch_step] = self.epoch_metrics.copy()\r\n        self.flush_log()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn catalyst/catalyst/loggers/ensorboard.py:\r\n\r\n  In TensorboardLogger(ILogger):\r\n  \r\n    ```\r\n        def log_weights(\r\n            self,\r\n            runner: \"IRunner\",\r\n        ) -> None:\r\n            \"\"\"Logs model weights to Tensorboard for current epoch.\"\"\"\r\n            assert runner.loader_key is not None\r\n            # check saving weights is possible\r\n            if 'named_parameters' in dir(runner.model):\r\n                self._check_loader_key(loader_key=runner.loader_key)\r\n                # log weights of model\r\n                for name, params in runner.model.named_parameters():\r\n                    # save weights as histogram\r\n                    self.loggers[runner.loader_key].add_histogram(\r\n                        tag=name, values=params, global_step=runner.epoch_step,\\\r\n                        bins='tensorflow'\r\n                    )\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nI think it would be as easy as that?\r\n\r\nThe runner class holds the model and epoch number, so each logger can easily add a histogram with those values. I am unsure how to log model weights from scikit-learn so that could be a problem?\r\n\r\nIt would probably be wise to add the self.log_weights() to experiment start as well. I am unsure how the engine works, so will leave that up to you
