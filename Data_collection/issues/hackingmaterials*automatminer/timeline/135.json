A lot of times in matsci predictions we are looking for outliers (which material is the hardest, most conductive, etc.), and being able to predict them is important. \r\n\r\nFor the Analytics part, the outlier analysis should mainly be looking at which *predictions* were farthest from their true values, and possibly why. We can also look at the outliers based on actual value.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/440116062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2017677591,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjAxNzY3NzU5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/2017677591","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-11T04:25:56Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2126123229,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjEyNjEyMzIyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/2126123229","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-08T03:07:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
