am fine with the proposed pipeline (nice flowchart BTW). I think it's ok if we automatically do some preprocessing and logging it. That could be the default behavior. If someone wants to change something in their pipeline, they can define a new one (as simple as copy and pasting 10 lines of codes) and then change the args within each step or even taking out some steps (e.g. feature reduction). In other words, make their custom pipeline while taking advantage of convenience functions available in matbench. Similar philosophy is implemented in atomate where the user don't have much control over every step of the calculations, only the main stuff, but if they want more control they can define the same workflow but just change a small portion (as I have).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/426813025/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"albalu","id":14810408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODEwNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14810408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu","html_url":"https://github.com/albalu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/426813485","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/88#issuecomment-426813485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/88","id":426813485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjgxMzQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"Doppe1g4nger","id":7992266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTIyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7992266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger","html_url":"https://github.com/Doppe1g4nger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doppe1g4nger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-03T21:41:27Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T21:41:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see your point, I think that's something that can be handled in the preprocessing module though.
