Issues closed\r\n- Closes #148 \r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n- [x] Updated matminer in requirements to newest version (breaking previous version)\r\n- [x] Updated imports in lesson and exercise code cells which were broken caused by matminer breaking changes in 0.7.x\r\n- [x] Fixed various typos and nasty-looking code outputs to more readable versions\r\n- [X] ~~Created figrecipes pypi package (as it is no longer in matminer proper but the teaching notebook relies on it), added it to requirements - hopefully this does not cause depdendency hell, I tried to avoid that by taking @shyamd `==` vs `>=` advice from [here](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/382) ; updated nb code to reflect new figrecipes imports; also, made the graphs look better~~\r\n- [X] Replace Figrecipes with plotly express\r\n\r\n# Need feedback before proceeding\r\n- [X] Remove automatminer code section: reason being amm has not been updated in a while and does not work with newest matminer, will almost certainly cause dependency problems unless update;  I likely will not be able to update amm before MPWorkshop starts. Maybe we can replace current automatminer code section with just a brief infographic overview of what is does? Need @shyamd opinion\r\n- [X] Add infographic section on matbench, including short interactive part for exploring the datasets on MPContribs; we can put the matbench docs under an MP domain if desired. Need @mkhorton @shyamd guidance on what to do here. Can add code section on how to use the [matbench python package](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matbench) but am not sure if this is desired or not.
