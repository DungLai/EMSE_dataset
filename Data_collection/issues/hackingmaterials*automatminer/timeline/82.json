on the discussion in #82, the testing of `AllFeaturizers` has been improved.\r\n\r\nThe test now checks that a potential featurizer is:\r\n1.  A subclass of `BaseFeaturizer`.\r\n2. Not `BaseFeaturizer` itself.\r\n3. Defined in the module rather than just imported.\r\n\r\nWith this in place, the only \"non-featurizer\" I had to check for was `StructureComposition`. Unless accessory featurizers like this are added in the future the tests should work fine.\r\n\r\nI also made it so that if a featurizer is not implemented, the error message will state which featurizer has caused the error.\r\n\r\nOne question: currently the tests check that the number of featurizers implemented is equal to the number of featurizers available in matminer. What happens if other packages implement useful featurizers in the feature and we would like to use those in matbench?\r\n\r\nIs this check really necessary when we are already testing that matbench includes all the matminer featurizers anyway?\r\n\r\n*Also, ignore my commit message, not sure what I was trying to type there 😂*","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/428425661","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/82#issuecomment-428425661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/82","id":428425661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODQyNTY2MQ==","user":{"login":"utf","id":1330638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1330638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf","html_url":"https://github.com/utf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-10T03:27:27Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T03:27:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed by #90 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/428425661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"utf","id":1330638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1330638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf","html_url":"https://github.com/utf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1894433342,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg5NDQzMzM0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/1894433342","actor":{"login":"utf","id":1330638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1330638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf","html_url":"https://github.com/utf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-10T03:27:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
