@janosh thanks for the bug report. I've been aware of this problem for some time and am actually currently running some tests to try and pinpoint it.\r\n\r\nI actually think this is a bug with matminer and job parallelization with `mulitprocessing`. For example, if you try just using `StructuretoOxidStructure` etc. from matminer I'd wager you'd see the same issues. \r\n\r\nWhat I _think_ is happening behind the scenes is when `n_jobs` is high (relative to the compute ability of whatever machine you are running it on), the expensive chunks are delegated very few compute cycles by the CPU and/or are not allocated sufficient memory. I don't think there is any infinite loop happening (AFAIK) but the CPU is not allowing a highly parallelized process to run efficiently. \r\n\r\n## Some tests to try\r\nDoes running the bare featurizers (without automatminer) still have this problem? My guess is yes.\r\n\r\nIf so, does setting n_jobs for an individual featurizer change the halting behavior whatsoever? My guess is that if you set n_jobs=1 the job will go very slowly but eventually finish, and if you turn n_jobs very high you increase the probability it halts indefinitely.
