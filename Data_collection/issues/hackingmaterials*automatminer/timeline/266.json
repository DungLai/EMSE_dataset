The \"powerups\" are intended to be common options that are applied to the pre-defined presets. The idea is that if you want to enable some common options while using a preset (e.g., cache the features in some file, set the number of jobs, etc.) you don't need to specify an entire custom pipeline for MatPipe.\r\n\r\nFor example, `n_jobs` is a powerup which can be applied to any of the presets to define the number of jobs for featurization and learning across the entire pipeline. Similarly, the `target_output_col` (or whatever name) could be a powerup which sets the output col name. \r\n\r\nSo without making it a powerup, if you wanted to set the output col name, you'd need to either define and entire custom pipeline (bad, lots of work [relatively]) or get the preset config and then replace the AutoFeaturizer with a custom one (less bad, but still not intuitive).\r\n\r\nMaking it a powerup in `get_preset_config`, you could just:\r\n```\r\npipe = MatPipe.from_preset(\"express\", target_output_col=\"custom column name\")\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/555177720/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/555189957","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/266#issuecomment-555189957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/266","id":555189957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTE4OTk1Nw==","user":{"login":"janosh","id":30958850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30958850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh","html_url":"https://github.com/janosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-18T20:14:54Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T20:14:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see what you mean.
