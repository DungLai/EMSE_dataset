Please post questions like this on our discussion forum (https://matsci.org), the issue tracker is used for internal development only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current requirements for targets\r\n\r\nFeatureReducer requires a target because the underlying algorithms require targets. For example, reduction via correlation coefficients requires a target. The ensemble-based reduction in FR also requires targets.\r\n\r\nDataCleaner requires a target because it automatically cleans training samples missing parse-able target values during fitting. While not extensively used, it is required.\r\n\r\nAutoFeaturizer can use a target when retrieving cached features to help in validating the retrieved data is correct. However it is not _needed_ most of the time, but is enforced nonetheless.\r\n \r\n### Supervised vs Unsupervised\r\n\r\nThis package is intended to work as a **supervised end to end pipeline** first and foremost. However, I don't see why it can't be used for feature generation or other things for unsupervised tasks. I'd be glad to accept a pull request doing this, so if you have code to contribute, please make a PR! The things we could do are:\r\n\r\n- Learners and FeatureReducer: These will remain with a mandatory target.\r\n- DataCleaner: make target usage an optional field, and disable target checking in the case target isn't provided.\r\n- AutoFeaturizer: I think the target usage can be removed, but we need to look into the caching behaviour for stored features.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/691567758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3759858661,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3NTk4NTg2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/3759858661","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T23:00:40Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"76e56e"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3759858662,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3NTk4NTg2NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/3759858662","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T23:00:40Z","label":{"name":"patch","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3759858735,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzNzU5ODU4NzM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/3759858735","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T23:00:45Z","assignee":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","follow
