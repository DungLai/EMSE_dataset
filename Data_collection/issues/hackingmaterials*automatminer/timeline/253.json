of passing around logger objects, automatminer classes should just use the module level logger. This should be defined at the top of each file (that wants to use logging) as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe module level logger is then used directly inside each class as normal, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass CustomClass(object):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        logger.info(\"Some log message\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe decision of how to print/write log messages can then be handled separately by adding handlers to the root `\"automatminer\"` logger, without having to worry about passing round a custom logger. Using the module level logger avoids the need to pickle anything as the logger is defined in the scope of the module and is not an instance variable.\r\n\r\nYou can have the automatminer classes add handlers to the automatminer logger by default if you always want log messages to be displayed. Note that this is not a very user-friendly way of treating logging. Generally logging is something that you opt-in to, rather than have to opt-out from. I can definitely see the benefits of having logging by default though.\r\n\r\nYou can use an updated version of the current `initialize_logger` function for adding the handlers. Something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef initialize_logger(log_dir='.', level=None) -> logging.Logger:\r\n    \"\"\"Initialize the default logger with stdout and file handlers.\r\n\r\n    Args:\r\n        log_dir (str): Path to the folder where the log file will be written.\r\n        level (int): The log level. For example logging.DEBUG.\r\n\r\n    Returns:\r\n        (Logger): A logging instance with customized formatter and handlers.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    level = level or logging.INFO\r\n\r\n    logger = logging.getLogger(\"automatminer\")\r\n\r\n    logger.handlers = []  # reset logging handlers if they already exist\r\n\r\n    formatter = logging.Formatter(fmt='%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s',\r\n                                  datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\r\n\r\n    logpath = os.path.join(log_dir, \"automatminer\")\r\n    if os.path.exists(logpath + \".log\"):\r\n        logpath += \"_\" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')\r\n    logpath += \".log\"\r\n\r\n    handler = logging.FileHandler(logpath, mode='w')\r\n    handler.setFormatter(formatter)\r\n    screen_handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)\r\n    screen_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\r\n\r\n    logger.setLevel(level)\r\n    logger.addHandler(screen_handler)\r\n    logger.addHandler(handler)\r\n    return logger\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the handlers are added to the root \"automatminer\" logger, you don't need to pass around the logger object as the logger and handlers are stateful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/543452298/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"utf","id":1330638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1330638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf","html_url":"https://github.com/utf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2725733995,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjcyNTczMzk5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/2725733995","actor":{"login":"utf","id":1330638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1330638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf","html_url":"https://github.com/utf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-18T17:55:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2725733996,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3MjU3MzM5OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/2725733996","actor":{"login":"utf","id":1330638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1330638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf","html_url":"https://github.com/utf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-18T17:55:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/543862464","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/253#issuecomment-543862464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/253","id":543862464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mzg2MjQ2NA==","user":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T17:58:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T17:59:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So
