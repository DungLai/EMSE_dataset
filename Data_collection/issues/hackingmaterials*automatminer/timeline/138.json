removed the custom oxidation state conversion featurizers and updated the code to use the latest improvements in pymatgen (materialsproject/pymatgen#1353) and matminer (hackingmaterials/matminer#339) so that large structures are handled gracefully.\r\n\r\nThis pull request (along with the matminer improvements) should also fix #138, as now the compositions are always calculated directly from the structure (after oxidation states have been added).\r\n\r\nWe should hold off merging this until both the matminer and pymatgen PR have been
