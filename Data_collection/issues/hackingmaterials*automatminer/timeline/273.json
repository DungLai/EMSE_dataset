My hesitation is that none of the current default configs support this action (i.e., will never produce multiple outputs) so the only people who'd be using it are those who are already making their own highly customized pipelines. \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't introduce too much code complexity and have one preset demonstrating this behavior, I'd be in favor of it. Since it's going to be a relatively large upgrade though, I'm marking this for the next _major_ release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/558297196/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2829290112,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgyOTI5MDExMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/2829290112","actor":{"login":"janosh","id":30958850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30958850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh","html_url":"https://github.com/janosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-25T19:08:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2829290128,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4MjkyOTAxMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/2829290128","actor":{"login":"janosh","id":30958850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30958850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh","html_url":"https://github.com/janosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-25T19:08:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
