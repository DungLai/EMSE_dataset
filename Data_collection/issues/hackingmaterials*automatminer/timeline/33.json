Regarding CV and TPOT, so we just have to make sure we set the cv that TPOT uses internally to 5 by default but of course give the option to change it. I have also read that it is indeed \"best practice\" to split the data into train/dev/test and don't touch the test set until the very end. The development subset \"dev\" is for tuning the hyperparameters, etc which is taken care of inside tpot/autosklearn/etc by maximizing cross-validated accuracy. We can set the default size of the test set to something like min(1000, 0.25*len(df)) and the rest is hopefully done by tpot, etc.\r\n\r\nOn how we should present the bias/variance after training, we should definitely debate. One idea is to do a final cross-validation on the selected model and report the cv score and its standard deviation to see how stable the cross-validation was. Another is to train the selected model automatically on 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the training data and plot the train/test errors vs. # of data points and let the user do the bias/variance analysis and decide on what to do next themselves. Finally, we can also separate out 10-100 mislabeled or predicted points that are \"off\" in regression and print to .csv for further error analysis (again bias/variance and error analyses are matbench suggested future work that must be done by the user, we just make it easier to do). Before I get too excited we should decide on what is that \"selected\" model and if the CV scores are not stable as you mentioned, how do we decide which one is better?...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/405752552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"albalu","id":14810408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODEwNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14810408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu","html_url":"https://github.com/albalu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albalu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1738882774,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTczODg4Mjc3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/1738882774","actor":{"login":"spacedome","id":5671521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzE1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5671521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome","html_url":"https://github.com/spacedome","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-17T22:46:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1738882775,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3Mzg4ODI3NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/1738882775","actor":{"login":"spacedome","id":5671521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzE1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5671521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome","html_url":"https://github.com/spacedome","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-17T22:46:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/406431543","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/33#issuecomment-406431543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/33","id":406431543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjQzMTU0Mw==","user":{"login":"spacedome","id":5671521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzE1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5671521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome","html_url":"https://github.com/spacedome","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-19T22:17:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T22:17:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For the TPOT example, yes I think setting the internal cv to 5-fold by default is a good choice. This automatically deals with the (dev) validation splits, which are part of k-fold, so only a holdout test set needs to be split before passing the training data to TPOT. Setting a upper bound for the test set size (e.g. 1000) is probably a bad idea, as this would cause high variance in the test score for large datasets. It would be better to keep it as a percentage. For very large data sets (DNN with tens of millions of images) they still keep ~10% or so as a test set. For example in ImageNet there are 1000 categories, so sampling 1000 test points would likely not even give test points in many categories, and with stratification gives only one test point per category. This would have a lot of variance depending on the sample, and likely would give poor estimates of the true generalization error.\r\n\r\nTo do a final cross validation without introducing bias, it would need to be a nested cross validation, meaning for each fold you would have to fully re-run TPOT on the subset. You probably don't want to do this, due to the cost of running TPOT, running it 5 or 10 times is not worth it compared to keeping a hold out test set. Not only is a hold out test set simpler (both computationally and in implementation) but I've found it gives better results. It would only be worth doing a nested cross-validation on a very small data set, and it then gives the problem of how to interpret the results. With CV model selection (i.e. TPOT) followed by a test set evaluation, you can interpret \"this is the best model, and this is how it likely will perform on new data\", but with nested cross validation you have to interpret the final result as \"this is how well the model i can find using this model selection procedure, if trained on the whole data set, would likely perform on new data\". It is a valid approach but conceptually more convoluted.\r\n\r\nIn terms of measuring the standard deviation of cv score, this would not give you the results you want. If you take the sample standard deviation of the fold scores, the result will be highly biased. In fact, there is \"No Unbiased Estimator of the Variance of the K-Fold CV\" (Bengio 2004), and naive estimators will have bias on the order of magnitude as the total variance, making the numbers essentially meaningless. There are ways to make a less biased, conservative estimator of the variance, but it's quite difficult, there's no easy way to get the std. \r\n\r\nTraining the selected model on subsets of the data might be a good way to show if the model is being over-fit (which can be interpreted as high model variance), but I'm not sure how you could get any information from that about the bias / variance of the generalization error.\r\n\r\nI think that fortunately when models perform roughly as well as each other during model selection, and one is selected over another due to variance, they would likely both perform equally well in practice. You don't necessarily have to worry about choosing the \"optimal\" model, and in some sense any model you choose could be equally good (you can look up \"No Free Lunch Theorem\" if you want to go down that rabbit hole). \r\n\r\nI don't think there's necessarily any good way to show bias/variance after training, in general it may not be possible to quantify this very well at all. There are many special cases though where it is easier, for example (I think) for linear models. There are some more general techniques in the literature, but I don't particularly understand them. I believe there are papers about this, in particular in the context of model comparison, in Machine Learning and Statistical Learning Theory. There is one by Bengio (2004), _Inference for the Generalization Error_ that gives a conservative estimator for the variance of a specific form of CV (not k-fold), though personally I don't entirely understand it. Beyond that I haven't found too much. There is also _A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection_ (Arlot 2010) which gives a survey, but it is somewhat long and from a very mathematical perspective.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/406431543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"spacedome","id":5671521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzE1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5671521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome","html_url":"https://github.com/spacedome","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spacedome/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1930141703,"node_id":"MDE5OkFkZGVkVG9Qcm9qZWN0RXZlbnQxOTMwMTQxNzAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/events/1930141703","actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-27T04:20:33Z","project_card":{"id":14265025,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/14265025","project_id":1875075,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/1875075","column_name":"eventually"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-01T04:52:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T04:52:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/pull/112","id":376249191,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI3NTA5Nzk5","number":112,"title":"a
