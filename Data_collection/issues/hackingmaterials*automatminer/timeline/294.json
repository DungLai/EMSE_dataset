experimental [ID: 152463](https://citrination.com/datasets/152463) from [here](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/TC/C5TC04339E#!divAbstract)~~\r\n\r\n- `ucsb thermoelectrics` which was recently added to matminer (2021.06.07)\r\n\r\n- 585 superconductor temperatures [ID: 2210](https://citrination.com/datasets/2210) mentioned [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40192-017-0098-z)\r\n\r\n- 786 materials, 26 with curie point beyond 400k for 2D ferromagnets from [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-0300-2)\r\n\r\n- ~~expt_formation_enthalpy from matminer.datasets - @rkingsbury has already done a lot of work on this as far as cleaning for another project!~~\r\n- `expt_formation_enthalpy_kingsbury` from matminer\r\n\r\n- composition hv set from @sgbaird \r\n> - Composition/hardness dataset (~1000 points) scraped from the literature. [GitHub](https://github.com/BrgochGroup/VickersHardnessPrediction) (see `hv_comp_load.xlsx`), [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202005112)\r\n\r\n- **ternary nitrides set known as `tholander_nitrides` in matminer**\r\n\r\n### Amendments\r\n\r\n- dielectric must remove n=1 entries which have since been deprecated/removed by MP\r\n- expt_gap and expt_is_metal Cd2Te should be examined\r\n- matbench_mp_* datasets should be remade to reflect SCAN functional and new energies\r\n- remove `log10(*_VRH)=0.0` `(*_VRH=1.0)` entries from `matbench_log_*_vrh` datasets, as per @CompRhys comment; update data with newest from mp\r\n- remove isolated atoms from MP datasets as per @CompRhys comment\r\n- Update `steels_yield` to include more information about the samples (are they multiphase or single phase austentite) as well as _include the temperature_ as an extra variable for prediction (for more info see [original source dataset no. 153092](https://citrination.com/datasets/153092/show_search?searchMatchOption=fuzzyMatch) and [potential predecessor dataset no. 114165](https://citrination.com/datasets/114165/show_search?searchMatchOption=fuzzyMatch)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Structural changes\r\n- create tests that reflect use case: e.g., jdft2d should be evaluated on ability to identify mats with low exfoliation energy, glass should be organized according to chemical space, etc.\r\n- formation energy validation should be changed to reflect [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00362-y)\r\n- allow for use of extra features (which can and should be used for prediction, esp. for experimental samples, e.g. Temperature in an updated `steels_yield`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Evaluation changes\r\n- Include LOCO-CV or some method of clustering groups\r\n\r\n### Major extras and/or new benchmarks\r\n- Adaptive design/in the loop\r\n- Structure generation\r\n- Include time of evaluation as a metric (as extremely expensive algorithms can be counterproductive especially for in the loop methods)\r\n- Additions of new more \"industrial\" datasets including more diverse classes of materials, e.g. MOFs, as well as degrees of freedom or extra information (e.g., Temperature)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/materialsproject/matbench/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/materialsproject/matbench/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/comments/787031370","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/294#issuecomment-787031370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/294","id":787031370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NzAzMTM3MA==","user":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-27T07:47:04Z","updated_at":"2021-02-27T07:47:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"migrated
