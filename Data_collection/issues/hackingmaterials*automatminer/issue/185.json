LocalPropertyDifference)\r\n- [x] Flat version of SineCoulombMatrix or CoulombMatrix\r\n\r\nAdding these and then evaluating whether we should add them to automatminer (i.e., by evaluating them by themselves on some easy test problems using the same model) should be a priority.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
