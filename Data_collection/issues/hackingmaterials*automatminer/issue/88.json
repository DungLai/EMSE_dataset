E.g. what are currently the top level modules metalearning, featurization, and preprocessing. \r\n\r\nI think it was agreed that metalearning isn't a very accurate descriptor of what that submodule does. I think a better name would be something like \"heuristic featurizer selection\" or maybe just \"featurizer selection\". \r\n\r\nA bigger sell I'd also like to put forward is that preprocessing is a bit of a misnomer for what that submodule currently does. Really all three of the above submodules are part of a preprocessing pipeline. What is currently preprocessing is more accurately a combined data cleaning and feature pruning step. It would make sense to bundle each of these under a comprehensive \"preprocessing\" or \"data handling\" module and split out the functionality of each submodule into its constituent steps. That way every top level module produces some complete product for the user and submodules then represent steps to completing that product. See the below diagram on what I think the better structure would look like:\r\n\r\n![higher_res_pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7992266/46437888-46bd9080-c711-11e8-833e-a55a68265367.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/88/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/88/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
