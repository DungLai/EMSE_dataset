It could be even excel file with different sheets such as featurize profile/summary, preprocess profile/summary and machine learning profile/summary. Then I will know for example at the end 100 cross-correlated features were removed in preprocess and such as such algorithms were tried and these are their scores and these features turn out to be the most important.\r\n\r\n* Note that all of this info is already available via logger but it looks messy so we need a to_file method or something organizing this results.
