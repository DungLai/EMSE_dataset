I don't know if it is my incorrect parameter setting or the program itself. I hope my question can be answered, thank you very much!\r\nIn addition, if this method cannot make the program parallel and then speed up, I would like to ask if there are other reasonable methods that can be used to speed up machine learning.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
