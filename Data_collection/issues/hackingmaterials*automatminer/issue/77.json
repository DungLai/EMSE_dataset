You could of course have the standard matminer structure/composition features and use that as your candidate feature set.\r\n\r\nBut another option is to use a different matbench (or other ML) model as a feature as well. For example, let's say you previously made a matbench model to relate structure/composition->bulk modulus. Now, when you are predicting *band gap*, you can use that previous matbench model to get a value for bulk modulus which becomes a new feature for band gap prediction.\r\n\r\nRelated ideas include the papers:\r\n[1] M.L.
