In addition it seems we've settled on using tpot as the main model selection tool rather than automl. \r\n\r\nI think the current naming is confusing as it makes it hard to understand that the tool being used isn't necessarily automl and it's not immediately clear that automl_utils.py holds utilities for using the automl package, not our overall model selection part of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nI think a better naming convention for the submodule would be something that better reflects that the model selection isn't necessarily tied to any package but is meant for automatic model selection. So something like matbench.model_selection or matbench.auto_model_selector rather than matbench.automl","closed_by":{"login":"ardunn","id":19936203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM2MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19936203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn","html_url":"https://github.com/ardunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/87/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
