If we are going to have an analytics subpackage at all, we should at least test it right at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nA way around having to run ML code to test analytics is to just create a mock finished MatPipe. I.e., give it all the attributes and mock data a fitted matpipe would have, then test on that. We don't need to actually run a matpipe to generate test data for one.
