You should inherit from SummarizationReader class.\r\nExamples:\r\n- RIA reader, json format https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus/blob/master/summarus/readers/ria_reader.py\r\n- Lenta reader, tsv format https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus/blob/master/summarus/readers/lenta_reader.py\r\n- CNN\\Dailymail reader, some advanced format https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus/blob/master/summarus/readers/cnn_dailymail_reader.py\r\n\r\nSecond, you should preprocess your dataset to obtain vocabulary. You can use [preprocess.py](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus#preprocesspy) to do this. It requires a configuration file with reader settings. For example, \"reader\" section from [this file](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus/blob/master/summarus/tests/configs/ria_pgn.json#L51) and with your reader type will suffice.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use byte-pair encoding, run [train_subword_model.py](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus#train_subword_modelpy) first to get BPE model. Then you should use the [SubwordTokenzier](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus/blob/master/summarus/subword_tokenizer.py) in the reader config and the path to the BPE model as one of the fields of this config.\r\n\r\nThird, you should run [train.py](https://github.com/IlyaGusev/summarus#trainpy) with defined model configuration.\r\nConfiguration examples:
