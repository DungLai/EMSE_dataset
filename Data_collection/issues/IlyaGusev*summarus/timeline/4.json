I tried to follow your setting, but I can't find the path for the \"train-path\" parameter for preprocess.py.\r\n\r\nI think if you can provide some command in the README file, so we can just run script and get the data download, preprocess, training, evaluation process to go, that will be great!\r\n\r\nBecause now I have trouble understand the workflow of AllenNLP, and I can not find the training data, validation data, so it's hard for me to get the training process to run.\r\n\r\nIf I could run the training process properly, change the model to fit other task will be much easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IlyaGusev/summarus/issues/comments/507089705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zxr445116086","id":25470650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086","html_url":"https://github.com/zxr445116086","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxr445116086/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5040217447,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTA0MDIxNzQ0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IlyaGusev/summarus/issues/events/5040217447","actor":{"login":"IlyaGusev","id":2670295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzAyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2670295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev","html_url":"https://github.com/IlyaGusev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyaGusev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-19T18:58:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
