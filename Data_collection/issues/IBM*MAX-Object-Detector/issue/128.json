The usage is for a security surveillance setup in my boat, and I am basically only interested in detecting persons. \r\n\r\nCan I, using the Node-Red flow, be able to filter out only detections with persons? I get some false-positives and would like to remove these. I am not interested in \"teddy bear\" or \"TV\" matches. \r\n\r\nApologies if this is not the right forum!
