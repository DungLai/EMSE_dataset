If the resource is limited, is it impact the detection precision, or is it impact the length of the time to finish the detection.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the help!","closed_by":{"login":"bdwyer2","id":19673623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjczNjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19673623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2","html_url":"https://github.com/bdwyer2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/issues/157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
