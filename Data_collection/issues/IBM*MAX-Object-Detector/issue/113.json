I do have **TensorFlow** installed on this computer. Could I run some scripts to build the image myself? :)\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed that the version of python being used supposedly v2. Is there any support for v3?\r\n\r\nThese are not issues, _per se_, but clearly roadblocks in practicing your tutorials.
