My setup includes the use of Hass.IO, Node-Red, InfluxDB, MQTT, SignalK and ZigBee ZHA. This enable the use of sensors like water leak, vibration, temperature, moisture and various switches. I use Node-Red for automation of the battery charging and solar charge monitoring. There is a Victron battery monitor and MPPT solar charge controller, both which are connected to the Pi with USB serial cables. These feed data to Node-Red and automate the charge of my LiFePo4 battery bank. SignalK is reading NMEA data from my AIS tranceiver which provides location information (GPS). The network is provided by a WiFi router with SIM CARD and 4G support. \r\n\r\nAlso I have two cameras setup, currently using Dafang Hacked Xiaomi cameras. This summer I migrated to a Raspberry Pi 4 and I want to integrate my cameras with Tensorflow to reduce the false-positive motion messages. On a boat there is allways some motion, but 99% of this is not interesting so I need to use some ML to make sure I only get interesting alerting. Cloud integration is of course an option as long as I only use capture single images but if I could retain it all on the Pi I save data on my GSM SIM card. \r\n\r\nFunctionality that I am working at is for instance: \r\n\r\nWorking: \r\n - Alarm when the boat is moving more than 0,2 knots and the alarm is on\r\n - Alarm if water in the bilge\r\n - Alarm if motion on the camera, with sending a snapshot (HTML5 and Hangouts used for notification) - many false positives currently\r\n - Battery charging to target set in the UI. If target is 70% it charges to 70%, when the charge falls to 67% (-3%) then charge back to target. \r\n - Turn off/on dehumidifier from app\r\n - Turn off/on water heater\r\n - Show battery charge state\r\n - Show current usage/charge\r\n - Show Solar panel charge\r\n\r\nIn progress: \r\n - Alarm when vibration and the alarm is on\r\n - Alarm if battery lower than 20% / user configurable \r\n - Alarm if motion on cameras only by people\r\n - Alarm if moisture above x level (60%?)\r\n - Waste tank fill sensor (ESP sensor, ultrasonic)\r\n - Automate webasto heater\r\n - Automate aircondition control (ESP perhaps?)\r\n\r\nSo ... a lot of ideas still :)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"331\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-10-18 07 35 57\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138292/67068659-0c3b6000-f17b-11e9-836f-9c47f52d1e50.png\">\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/issues/comments/543521104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"corvy","id":138292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy","html_url":"https://github.com/corvy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corvy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/issues/comments/552678944","html_url":"https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/issues/72#issuecomment-552678944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/issues/72","id":552678944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjY3ODk0NA==","user":{"login":"bdwyer2","id":19673623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjczNjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19673623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2","html_url":"https://github.com/bdwyer2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdwyer2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T00:28:06Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T00:28:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @corvy if you change `FROM codait/max-base:v1.1.3` to `FROM codait/max-base:arm-arm32v7-v1.3.0` in the Dockerfile and `tensorflow==1.12.2` to `tensorflow==1.13.1` in `requirements.txt` you should be able to run this model on a Raspberry Pi.
