All the steps leading to deploying the docker image (on RPi3) worked. There was minor suggestion regarding a deprecated Numpy function but it was not a roadblock. Also, I read too much into the Python version. Please disregard it; I use only Python3 and your solution worked flawlessly.\r\nThe Swagger page was displayed in due course. Of course, I'm invoking the headless RPi3 (for tutorial purposes now) from an Ubuntu desktop with Firefox. I believe that it would be better for me to work locally on the RPi3 to view the output annotated images (unless you have an alternate suggestion). _In other words more self-study is needed on my part_.
