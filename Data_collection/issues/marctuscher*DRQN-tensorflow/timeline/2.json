However, for successful training of a Deep Q Network, datapoints need to be sampled mostly at random from the replay memory to keep the bias, a specific policy introduces low.  A tradeoff has to be made between successfully training an LSTM and not violating the DQN random sampling theorem too much.\r\n\r\n\"min_history\" (e.g. 4):\r\nFor a datapoint from the replay memory to be used for training, its observation needs to have \"min_history\" number of preceding observations . These observations are then fed through the LSTM to generate a meaningful initial LSTM state.\r\n\r\n\"states_to_update\" (e.g. 4 to 8):\r\nAfter generating a meaningful LSTM state, the next \"states_to_update\" datapoints from the replay memory are used to train the DRQN.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this topic, have a look
