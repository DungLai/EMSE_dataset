If I use your pretrained oe_tune models, the results are perfectly matched. However, I have a hard time trying to reproduce the OE fine-tune results on the paper. Some OOD datasets are off, though the average is similar. I have tried both pytorch 1.4 and 0.4. Here are the OOD datasets that are off after OE tuning (left columns are your pretrained OE model while right columns are our reproduced results). It is on cifar100_wrn_oe_tune. Would you mind taking a look and sharing your ideas/package versions?
