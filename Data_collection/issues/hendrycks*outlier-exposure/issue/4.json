For example, let's say I want to replicate the results for sst dataset with OE on the wikitext2 dataset. If I load your oe_tuned model and I run the script eval_OOD_sst, then I get results similar to the ones mentioned in the paper. \r\n\r\nHowever, whenever I run the baseline script in order to train the baseline model and then I run the oe script in order to fine-tune the model, then if I evaluate the fine-tuned model using the script eval_OOD_sst, the results are way different from the ones mentioned in the paper. I guess something is going on with the training process. But what could be the issue?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAris   ","closed_by":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
