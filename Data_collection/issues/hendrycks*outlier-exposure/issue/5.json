After the modifications you suggested, I was able to reproduce the results of the paper for the SST dataset.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a problem for the 20 Newsgroups dataset. When I evaluate your pretrained model, the results are way different from the ones mentioned in the paper. Actually, when we run the evaluation script for your model, the results we get are the following:\r\n\r\nOOD dataset mean FPR: 0.6828\r\nOOD dataset mean AUROC: 0.7115\r\nOOD dataset mean AUPR: 0.2773\r\n\r\nSo, what could be the issue? If the evaluation datasets are the same ones as the ones you used in the SST, I cannot find a reason for which your pretrained model does not give the results mentioned in the paper. Which version of the 20 Newsgroups did you use and how did you do the train/test split? we use the newsgroup available from sklearn library\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @AristotelisPap in https://github.com/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/4#issuecomment-517967141_","closed_by":{"login":"mmazeika","id":23729136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzI5MTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23729136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika","html_url":"https://github.com/mmazeika","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
