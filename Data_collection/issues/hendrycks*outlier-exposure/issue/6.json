Hence I was curious if the methodology can be applied to tasks where we do pixel-level prediction (example image translation) and use L1 or L2 loss? Similar to classification loss, if we use uniform random ground truth images as the label for ood images, will it work or dealing with pixel-level predictions, require a completely different methodology?","closed_by":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
