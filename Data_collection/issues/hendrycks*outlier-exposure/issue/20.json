Thank you for your excellent work. I have some questions about the implementation.\r\nWhen I change the train_loader_ood with shuffle = True and the ID classification drops a lot after finetuning the pre-trained WideResNet with lr 0.001 and weight_decay 0.0005. The fine-tuned WideResNet in Cifar10 has 88.59% test classification accuracy compared with 94.39%.\r\nInstead, you use a random offset to induce the randomness. Could you please clarify the reason for this operation?
