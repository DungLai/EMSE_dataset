The WikiText data loaders should be loading from a folder called wikitext_reformatted, which contains lightly filtered individual sentences of WikiText as opposed to BPTT segments. We briefly mention this in Section 4.2.2 of the paper. I uploaded the wikitext_reformatted folder to the NLP_classification folder with some instructions on how to set things up, and I corrected the data loaders in train_OE.py. This gives me numbers close those in the paper. Thanks for drawing my attention to this!\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nMantas","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/comments/515802920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmazeika","id":23729136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzI5MTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23729136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika","html_url":"https://github.com/mmazeika","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmazeika/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2515095279,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUxNTA5NTI3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/events/2515095279","actor":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T02:16:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/comments/517967141","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/4#issuecomment-517967141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/4","id":517967141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzk2NzE0MQ==","user":{"login":"AristotelisPap","id":39322801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzIyODAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39322801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap","html_url":"https://github.com/AristotelisPap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-04T01:49:34Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T01:50:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for the response. After the modifications you suggested, I was able to reproduce the results of the paper for the SST dataset.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a problem for the 20 Newsgroups dataset. When I evaluate your pretrained model, the results are way different from the ones mentioned in the paper. Actually, when we run the evaluation script for your model, the results we get are the following:\r\n\r\nOOD dataset mean FPR: 0.6828\r\nOOD dataset mean AUROC: 0.7115\r\nOOD dataset mean AUPR: 0.2773\r\n\r\nSo, what could be the issue? If the evaluation datasets are the same ones as the ones you used in the SST, I cannot find a reason for which your pretrained model does not give the results mentioned in the paper. Which version of the 20 Newsgroups did you use and how did you do the train/test split?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAris","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/outlier-exposure/issues/comments/517967141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AristotelisPap","id":39322801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzIyODAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39322801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap","html_url":"https://github.com/AristotelisPap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AristotelisPap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
