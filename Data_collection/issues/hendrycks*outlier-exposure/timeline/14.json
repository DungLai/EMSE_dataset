Hi, I have a pretty naive question so I don't open a new issue. Why are you taking the negative predicted/maximum softmax probabilities as the detection score (what's the purpose of the negative sign)? I'm new to OOD, but I thought larger values correspond to positive samples (in-distribution samples). And will this negative sign affect the AUROC results? Thanks in
